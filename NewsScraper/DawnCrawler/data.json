Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said the shooting late on Saturday in the borough\u2019s Brownsville section  \u201cwas a tragic end to a wonderful weekend\u201d where thousands of people had come to take part in the annual Old Timers Event, which he said had been held since 1963. The crowd at the celebration, which features musical performances from former residents and current local talent, was dispersing when gunshots rang out from a playground area in the park where it was taking place, officials said. Twelve people were hit seven men and five women between the ages of 21 and 55. A 38-year-old man died from a bullet wound to the head. His name was not immediately released. One of the injured was critical. Six of the wounded had been released from the hospital by midday Sunday, O\u2019Neill said.

Photos from local news outlets showed several people taken away on stretchers, including some with what appeared to be minor wounds. By midmorning, the area was cordoned off with police tape.

The clashes are the second consecutive day of violence in a city reeling from weeks of anti-government protests that show no sign of abating. Sunday\u2019s melees took place in a well-heeled residential district close to the Liaison Office, which represents Beijing in the semi-autonomous hub and which was pelted with eggs and paint last week. Police and protesters had been engaged in a tense standoff for hours after tens of thousands of demonstrators held a series of unsanctioned marches through the city. A group of some 200 protesters had made their way towards the Liaison Office in Sheung Wan district where they met a phalanx of riot police who used loudhailers calling for the crowds to end their  \u201cillegal assembly\u201d. Eventually, tear gas and rubber bullets were fired at demonstrators who responded with volleys of bricks and stones as baton-wielding riot police pushed the crowds back in some of the most sustained and violent clashes seen so far. Officers from the police\u2019s elite  \u201cRaptor\u201d squads made multiple arrests, almost all of them young men and women. Several protesters were injured, as well as two journalists. The renewed violence comes a day after a town near the border with mainland China descended into chaos as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters holding another banned rally against suspected pro-government triad gangs who beat up democracy demonstrators there last weekend. Despite facing unprecedented levels of public anger and frustration, the city\u2019s pro-Beijing leadership are seemingly unable, or unwilling, to end the chaos. Hong Kong has been plunged into its worst crisis in recent history after millions of demonstrators took to the streets and sporadic violent confrontations erupted between police and pockets of hardcore protesters. The demonstrations over the last seven weeks were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, but have evolved into a call for wider democratic reforms and a halt to sliding freedoms. Yet the unprecedented protests with huge turnouts \u2014 as well as frequent clashes and the sacking of parliament \u2014 have had little luck persuading Beijing or Hong Kong\u2019s leaders.", "category": "Archive"},

The victim was strangulated to death after an alleged sexual assault in Moria Faqeer village on the left bank of Dadu Canal, 23 kilometres from here, on July 24 within the remit of the Naudero police station. She had left home to buy milk from a nearby cattle pen and did not return. The relatives mounted a search for the girl and found her body stuffed in a gunny bag in a guava orchard. DIG-Larkana Irfan Baloch told Dawn that ASP-City Muhammed Kaleem Malik would head the team with two inspectors \u2014 Ghulam Hussain Dahri and Yaseen Tagar \u2014 and the SHO of the Naudero police station, Ali Hassan, as its members.  The team would probe into the contents of the FIR and submit a report, he added.  He said that Larkana SSP Masood Bangsh had written to the director general of the health services for constituting a medical board to assist the police in assessing medical evidence in the case.  Responding to a question, the DIG said exhumation or to rely on the earlier evidence would depend on the the medical board.  He said officers Dahri and Tagar, who were presently posted in Hyderabad range, had been included in the investigation team on the request of the bereaved family.  The inspector general of police had transferred them to Larkana to undertake the assignment, police sources said.  The sources said that the medical board would also examine the case to ascertain the actual age of the student of class eighth who had been arrested in the case. The DIG said that relevant section of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 had been incorporated in the FIR, as the incident had triggered a sense of terror and harassment in the vicinity.  Police on late Saturday night had arrested another suspect nominated in the FIR and would obtain his remand from the court concerned on Monday (today).  Amir Bhutto wants justice  Former Sindh president of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Amir Bakhsh Bhutto visited village Moria Faqeer and offered condolence to the affected family.  Her father requested Mr Bhutto for his help as they were poor and had been going through mental agony over the cold-blooded murder of their daughter.  The family was satisfied with the DIG and SSP Larkana for conducting an impartial inquiry.  Mr Bhutto assured him of his full assistance and said that he had met the SSP-Larkana and asked him for fair investigation into the murder to provide justice to the victim\u2019s family.  He criticised the Sindh government for failing to curb crimes and said that the worsening law and order situation would leave its prints on entire society.  Sardar Taj Muhammed Domki, the Sindh president of the Pakistan Peoples Party-Shaheed Bhutto, also offered his condolences to the family. Civil society protest Meanwhile, condemning the barbaric act, activists of Awami Workers Party and Child Rights Committee stage a demonstration in front of the Larkana Press Club and demanded justice to the victim\u2019s family.  Mujeeb Pirzado, Atteq Chandio, Samee Kakipoto led the protest. They said the murder had sent a wave of insecurity in the area and traumatised the entire society, which demanded severe and exemplary punishment for the culprits.  They said the murder of an innocent girl had occurred in Naudero\u2019s vicinity, which is the political hub of the ruling PPP.

Earlier, the HEC issued a final direction to all the public and private universities of the country and their affiliated colleges to abolish two-year BA/BSc and start Associate Degree (AD) programmes from the next academic year. It also directed the public and private sector universities that they could not offer MA/MSc programmes after 2020, when the ongoing programmes end. It requires the degree colleges, not offering BS programmes, to change their current system, to start new Associate Degree (AD) programmes for which an outline has to be finalised yet. Such colleges reportedly don\u2019t have the required conditions and staff for launching the proposed programmes and need to build their capacity.   The move has caused concern among the stakeholders because it will deprive a large number of students of an opportunity to earn graduation or master\u2019s degrees as private candidates. Education circles are criticising the HEC decision, arguing that without developing the capacity of the educational institution to shift to the new mode the direction could not be implemented effectively. They also insist that the universities and colleges also did not have the capacity to meet the requirements of semester system. Still many education institutions were suffering because of implementation of the semester system without having required capacity. Analysts say that such decisions could not be taken overnight, nor implemented without meeting the basic requirements. Sources said the vice chancellors of all higher education institutions of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and federal capital Islamabad expressed their reservations regarding the move at a meeting with the HEC chairman Tariq Banuri last week.   Some of the VCs seeking anonymity told Dawn that they would write to the HEC for reviewing its decision of completely abolishing the two-year BA/BSc and MA/MSc programmes. They said they had told the HEC chairman that it was not possible for them to start Associate Degree programmes as they did not have the resources required for the purpose. They said the private students would be among the worst-hit as most of them came from less-privileged strata of society, having no access to good institutions.   \u201cWhat option have we left for them (private students)? Unfortunately, there is none. We have deprived them of the only option they had for grooming themselves by doing BA/BSc or MA/MSc. This policy will halt academic career of hundreds and thousands of students at the intermediate level, depriving them of all educational opportunities,\u201d a VC regretted. He said that in other words, through the initiative the HEC, instead of increasing opportunities of higher education, would be further decreasing the same. \u201cFemale students will be the most affected [by this policy]. Thousands of female students in far-flung areas usually go for BA/BSc and MA/MSc degrees either privately or as regular candidates (if a college is available) for personal grooming as well as better economic prospects,\u201d he added. The VCs, however, said the HEC chairman, during the meeting, had also suggested starting Associate Degree programmes for the private students as well. However, HEC chairman was not available for his comment despite several attempts made by this reporter to contact him.", "category": "Pakistan"},

The commission, which was formed in December last year, was supposed to complete the task of first-ever revision of the master plan within six months by July 13 deadline.  Govt decides to include more members in the body The sources said that during this period the commission members had finalised their recommendation reports, which were being consolidated.  While, a request for proposal (RFP) for hiring a consultant, who will complete almost 20 studies, for making the final revision is also completed and soon the government will hire a consultant through a competitive process.  The sources said that the government had directed that the new members should include architects, town planners, horticulturists, lawyers, environmentalist, engineers and representatives of the business community.  A source in the interior ministry said that the commission would study the available data to be presented by the convener and prepare within a month a draft report, including some specific points for a decision with focus on preserving and improving the green character of Islamabad. Meanwhile, the consultants will develop execution and implementation plans.  \u201cThe commission already has good experts who have done a great job in the first six months.

He said people of good repute would be selected so that the task of proper revision of Islamabad master plan was completed.  The Islamabad master plan was developed in 1960 by a Greek firm Doxiadis Associates, which was supposed to be revised after every 20 years, but successive governments did not make revision that resulted in poor planning.

Sixteen of the dead were decapitated in the second major eruption of violence to rock the country\u2019s severely overpopulated and deadly prison system in as many months. Fighting broke out in the Altamira Regional Recovery Centre at around 7am, an official from the Para state government\u2019s penitentiary department said. Two guards were taken hostage during the hours-long clashes, which were brought under control at around midday. They were eventually freed. Brazilian TV stations showed footage of thick black smoke rising from the prison compound and people sitting on the roof of a building. Other images showed flames inside a building that almost reached the ceiling and people, apparently prisoners, sitting on the ground outside. \u201cIt is likely that many detainees died from asphyxiation (from smoke),\u201d the government official said, adding the death toll could rise. Around 300 prisoners were being held at the jail, the official said, which reportedly has a capacity for 200. An outbreak of violence in the same prison in September 2018 left at least seven inmates dead, local media reported previously. Guards had apparently foiled an attempted prison escape. In May this year, at least 55 prisoners were killed in several jails in the neighbouring state of Amazonas in violence also blamed on an apparent drug trafficking gang dispute. Most of the victims were killed by asphyxiation, the state government said at the time. The federal government dispatched reinforcements to boost security in the jails. Brazil has the world\u2019s third largest prison population after the United States and China, with 726,712 inmates as of June 2016, according to official statistics. The population is roughly double the capacity of the nation\u2019s jails, which in the same year was estimated to be 368,049 inmates. The federal government had been expected to add another 115,000 inmates by the end of 2018, Human Rights Watch said in a recent report. Around 40 percent of the prison population is made up of pretrial detainees. Along with severe overcrowding and gang violence, riots and breakout attempts in Brazil\u2019s prisons are not uncommon.

The US Central Command confirmed that two US troops were killed, but provided no details. It said additional information was being withheld until 24 hours after notification of next of kin was complete. Attacks on US and Afghan forces have intensified in the run-up to presidential elections and violence marred the start of the campaign on the weekend, after President Ashraf Ghani insisted \u201cpeace is coming\u201d to the war-torn nation. At least 20 people were killed and 50 others wounded on Sunday in an attack targeting the Kabul office of Ghani\u2019s running mate, Amrullah Saleh. The violence came on the first day of campaigning for the elections, serving as a grim reminder of Afghanistan\u2019s woeful security situation and the sort of mayhem and murder that have beset previous polls. The attack began around 4:40pm, when a huge blast struck near the office of Green Trend, a youth and reform-focused civil society organisation Saleh heads. He escaped without serious injury, his office said. The interior ministry said the assault began when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-packed car at the entrance to the building, then three attackers ran inside. After about six hours the siege ended with all attackers killed and the rescue of about 150 people who had been trapped in the building, according to the interior ministry, which also provided the toll of 20 dead and 50 wounded. Earlier on Sunday, a buoyant Ghani kicked off his campaign by insisting \u201cpeace is coming,\u201d after nearly 18 years of conflict, and that pivotal talks with the Islamist extremist Taliban would take place. He is hoping to fend off challenges from 17 other candidates to score a second term at twice-postponed presidential elections now slated for September 28. On Saturday Ghani\u2019s peace minister, Abdul Salam Rahimi, said direct talks would take place with the Taliban within two weeks as part of a larger, US-led push for peace. Such a development could be crucial, as the Taliban \u2014 who now control or influence about half of Afghanistan \u2014 have so far refused to speak to Ghani\u2019s government. They consider the Kabul administration illegitimate. War aside, the country faces a host of major issues ahead of the election, including rocketing crime, a lacklustre economy, soaring unemployment, and crumbling infrastructure. Voters are despondent about the prospects of a fair election. Many worry about a repeat of violent attacks on previous polling stations by the Taliban and other insurgent groups trying to undermine Afghanistan\u2019s fragile democracy. Ghani insisted this year\u2019s vote would be \u201cclean\u201d, but distrust is rife. Sayed Jan, a 27-year-old student, said he won\u2019t be voting as he has lost faith since the 2014 election that was mired in allegations of fraud and ballot stuffing. \u201cWe have been betrayed by the candidates in the past. We cannot trust them this time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need peace in Afghanistan instead of elections. Even if I vote, the election will be fraudulent.\u201d", "category": "Archive"},

A key protest group, the Sudanese Professionals Association, said \u201clive ammunition\u201d had been used against a \u201crally of school students\u201d. In a post on its Facebook page, it urged \u201call citizens and medics\u201d to head to hospitals treating the wounded. In a separate statement, it called for nationwide protests against the \u201cmassacre,\u201d demanding that \u201cthe perpetrators be brought to justice\u201d. Hundreds of protesters later rallied in Khartoum\u2019s two districts of Bahri and Burri, but they were swiftly confronted by riot police who fired tear gas, witnesses said. The office of North Kordofan\u2019s governor announced an overnight curfew in four towns including Al-Obeid, starting Monday and continuing indefinitely. It added that all schools in the province had been told to suspend classes. Residents of Al-Obeid said the rally had been over a shortage of bread and fuel in the town. It was a sudden tripling of bread prices that initially triggered December protests against Bashir, which later turned into a nationwide movement against his three-decade rule. \u201cFor the past few days there has been a shortage of fuel and bread,\u201d an Al-Obeid resident said. \u201cSchool children were affected as there is no transport to help them reach their schools. Today, they staged a rally and when it reached downtown there were shots fired.\u201d The town had not previously witnessed major rallies against Bashir even as provinces, cities and towns were swept up by the campaign against his rule. Monday\u2019s deaths sparked calls for talks set for Tuesday to be suspended. \u201cWe cannot sit at the negotiating table with those allowing the killing of revolutionaries,\u201d Siddig Youssef, a prominent protest leader, said in a statement. Tuesday\u2019s talks were set to cover issues including the powers of the joint civilian-military ruling body, the deployment of security forces and immunity for generals over protest-related violence, according to protest leaders. The power-sharing deal agreed on July 17 provided for the establishment of a new governing body of six civilians and five generals. It was then to oversee the formation of a transitional civilian government and parliament to govern for 39 months, followed by elections.", "category": "Archive"},

President Vladimir Putin\u2019s top opponent was rushed to hospital on Sunday a day after almost 1,400 people were arrested at an unauthorised protest, in the largest police crackdown on dissent in recent years. Navalny was hospitalised following what was described as an acute allergic reaction, but his supporters later said they believed he had been exposed to poison. \u201cIt is indeed poisoning by some unknown chemical substance,\u201d his lawyer Olga Mikhailova told reporters Monday outside Moscow\u2019s hospital No 64, which treated Navalny. Navalny on Sunday had swollen eyelids, discharge in the eye and a rash on his upper body, his personal physician Anastasia Vasilyeva said. She told reporters on Monday that both she and the 43-year-old politician believe the reaction could have been a response to \u201csome chemical agent\u201d. Navalny has been in jail since last week for calling an unauthorised rally. Vasilyeva said doctors at the hospital diagnosed him with a skin condition, adding that he had improved after being treated with a steroid. But he has been sent back to jail despite needing to continue the treatment, she said, raising concerns over the danger to his health in prison and the possibility that his cell could be contaminated. A senior doctor at the hospital told reporters that Navalny\u2019s health was not under threat. But Vasilyeva accused the hospital doctors of not wanting to find out what caused Navalny\u2019s condition. \u201cAlexei has been clearly sent back to the detention centre on orders from above,\u201d she said. Vasilyeva is an ophthalmologist who had treated Navalny previously after he nearly lost the sight in one eye after an attack in 2017. He has never suffered from allergies in the past, she said. The Russian opposition leader is serving a 30-day jail sentence for calling Saturday\u2019s rally after authorities blocked prominent independent candidates from taking part in Moscow parliament elections in September. The Kremlin on Monday scrambled to contain a fresh political crisis after police brutally crushed a peaceful rally that saw thousands take to the Moscow streets at the weekend to urge the authorities to open up the tightly-controlled system.", "category": "Archive"},

Excellent"], "content": "THE debate about religion and science dates back centuries. The debate is not about a technical matter, but about two realms of knowledge \u2014 theological and scientific. There seems to be an epistemological clash of validity between the two, apparently with each claiming sway over human life. Faith leaders or ulema, in general, boast of having a godly system, which is eternally true, free from error and change. They underplay the hand of man in the understanding, interpretation and application of religious dogmas. Religious leaders are known to oppose scientific developments that they interpret as opposing the key notions of religion due largely to the fear that these would undermine the faith of believers. They may do it with sincerity to religion, and presumably, to save believers from error. Their tools to deny science are theological and based largely on discursive reason, and not necessarily empirical evidence. They do not always have at their disposal the modern tools of understanding religion, such as scientific history of religions, sociology, psychology, anthropology etc. Reza Aslan\u2019s work God: a Human History is illuminating; it explores how the evolution of religious impulses has taken place in the history of humankind. Scientists on the other hand, see science as a realm of knowledge strongly reliable, based on human reason and demonstrable empirical evidence. For them, it is a self-corrective and evolving project, modifying itself, and following new evidence through inductive experimentation. It is an approach to generating and judging knowledge. The debate between religion and science leaves us with no common ground. A religious mindset on the other hand, sees this changing nature of scientific discoveries as a weakness, boasting of perennial and unchanging \u2018truths\u2019. It prefers stability over change; it is dogma-based. In almost all religions, historically opposition to science and scientists has been proverbial, leading to prejudices against, and torture of, scientists, as they are seen as \u2018perverted\u2019 souls, hell-bent on defying religious dogmas. This happens often because they use theological criteria to judge science; it is exactly like scientists judging religion or spirituality based on their experimental approach. The debate between religion and science, put simply, leaves us with no common ground. I, for one argue that the epistemological approaches (forms of knowing and their validity criteria) to both religion and science need to be treated differently as they require different ways of establishing (methodology) and judging (criteria of truth) knowledge and truth claims. We need to be sophisticated enough to see these differences so that we understand each through its own perspective, avoiding one criterion for judging both. Each branch of science requires different methodologies to study it. Similarly, within religion each branch requires different methodologies of study such as law or spirituality, language or ritual. Thus, when the ulema judge science using theology, they inevitably make the same mistake as those scientists who judge religion using the scientific method. So, it is necessary that we treat both of them differently, which means we do not downgrade either of them, but acknowledge the unique contribution of each to human welfare.  In my lectures and visits to international audiences, I am always asked by young people the fashionable question: \u2018What contribution has religion made to human progress in the last 500 years?\u2019 This is obviously done keeping the magnificent scientific contributions at the back of their mind. I argue, \u2018What contributions could one expect from religion to make?\u2019 Did we expect religion to make a technological revolution?  By nature, what science does can be seen and observed; but the transformation brought about by religion in the inner core of people is invisible. However, though exceptional civilisational achievements might have been possible thanks to scientists, it is impossible to ignore the religious \u2018faith\u2019 impulse within, and the spiritual inspiration behind for example, civilisational art and architectural marvels, and literary jewels. It is unfair to expect religion to bring, say, a super technological revolution. The major purpose of religion is to not to make technological advances, but to carry out \u2018inner engineering\u2019, and transformations, and make people virtuous. In sum, let us avoid rejecting a scientific approach to solving human problems at the altar of religion; nor should we reject religion because it does not work like science. Let us celebrate both as they address different dimensions of human yearning equally. As the Quran (2:201), says, \u201c...Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter. ...\u201d. So we seek the best of both religion and science. Let the ulema become a bridge between the two.", "category": "Archive"},

This means a relatively higher proportion of the country\u2019s educated workers is sitting at home hoping to find a decent job. Students dream about enrolling in top-tier universities because they believe that those institutions are their gateway to well-paid jobs and professional success. Unfortunately, only a handful of institutions across all fields of study can truly groom their students. So the problem of most varsities being under par is a severe one. Top business schools are considered a ticket to an executive job in any top corporation. This is due to the fact that these schools recognise the needs of the market and develop their students accordingly. The courses they offer, the curriculum they teach, the quality of their faculty and their contact base are such that their students don\u2019t have a hard time finding jobs. The quality of coursework and the faculty in universities are severely under par  Even though there some business schools that are working hard to achieve the top local standard, most schools are still at rock bottom. The quality of their coursework and faculty, their enrolment criteria and the average student profile are severely under par. Obsolete textbooks, lack of substantial research and students technically bribing their institutions to get their degrees are common. In science as well, only a handful of universities produce quality doctors and engineers. Graduates from most medical schools are unskilled and lack confidence to actually deal with a patient. That is because too much theoretical teaching takes place at medical schools without any emphasis on practical work.  Similarly, we often hear jokes about unemployed engineers. Despite being a distinguished field globally, engineering does not get the respect it deserves in Pakistan. That is so because too many universities produce too many engineers even though their demand is limited owing to Pakistan\u2019s underdeveloped industrial base. Lots of schools have a low merit criterion. So it\u2019s easy for anyone to enrol, which raises the supply of potential engineers. Many engineering schools lack advanced labs with relevant instruments. They are theoretical in their teaching and students are encouraged to learn by rote. That is why such students struggle to find a decent job in the local market. Most graduates from middle-class or lower-class households can\u2019t afford to go abroad to find jobs as the local market is too saturated. They can\u2019t afford to live or even study abroad. They often can\u2019t fulfil immigration requirements of developed countries. Students of social sciences and humanities face the worst prospects. As few organisations in Pakistan are interested in research, such graduates suffer the most. Most of them get employment in academia. But even there, supply exceeds demand. Of late, however, some corporations have started hiring psychology specialists as HR executives. Some psychologists open their clinics. But their businesses don\u2019t generally do well because of the negative perception about seeking mental health in our society. The Higher Education Commission (HEC) is the regulatory body for all universities in Pakistan. It is its responsibility to make sure the quality of university education is up to par. The HEC is trying to push institutions to recruit more PhDs as faculty members. According to Employers\u2019 Federation of Pakistan Chairman Majyd Aziz, faculty members do not have the exposure to trade and industry. \u201cThey are normally fresh graduates who teach through PowerPoint presentations made through textbooks. They are unable to back their teaching with practical experience. Universities should send their faculty members to the industry for three to six months on a voluntary basis. This will give them practical knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cPakistan needs proficient managers, not hopeless drones with degrees.\u201d Shazia Farooq, a visiting faculty member at the Institute of Business Administration, said that students should enhance their skills through Massive Open Online Courses, which are available online for free. \u201cStudents should also improve their work ethic and attitude. They should be more willing to put in extra hours since supply is becoming increasingly elastic,\u201d she said. ", "category": "Archive"},

Although floods are natural phenomena, human activities and human interventions into the processes of nature, such as alterations in the drainage patterns from urbanisation, agricultural practices and deforestation, have considerably changed the situation in \u2026 river basins. \u2026The probability of flooding is expected to increase; the earth\u2019s climate is changing rapidly. As far as possible, human interference into the processes of nature should be reversed, compensated and, in the future, prevented. It is necessary to promote \u2026 changes in water policies and land use practices....  All appropriate action should be taken to create legal, administrative and economic frameworks that are \u2026 enabling and within which the public, private and voluntary sectors can each make their contribution to flood prevention, dam safety and the reduction of adverse impacts of dangerous flood events. \u2026\u2014 (June 3)", "category": "Archive"},
{"title": "How ", "image_urls": ["https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/07/5d2d714cef266.jpg"], "published_date": " ", "updated_date": [" "], "authors": ["Jahanzeb Hussain"], "tweets": [], "comments": [], "content": "\"The goal of journalism to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comforted and to give voice to the voiceless, is one that guides us in what we cover, how we cover it and who we speak to,\" states the mission statement of  , a well-known Arabic and English online journalism platform from Egypt. In a depressing human rights landscape in that country and the region overall,   shines bright as one of the few beacons of hope.  The independent publication was founded in Cairo by a group of young journalists six years ago. I met up with  \u2019s co-founder and chief editor   in Germany at the Kultur Symposium last month. We spoke about the birth of the publication, the pressures it faces from the Egyptian authorities and how Lina manages to run the operation in a testing environment; an environment that journalists in Pakistan may relate to.  The interview below has been edited for clarity. In 2013, a group of journalists and I were working for a big media company, and there came a point when they didn\u2019t want us to work for them anymore.  It was also the year when there were mass protests against the elected Islamist government [in Egypt] that eventually led to a takeover by the military, which continues to rule the country up until this moment.  So when we were shown the door by this media company, there was no other option for us to continue doing what we were doing except that if we created our own institution. At the same time, we sensed the urgency because we felt that the country was going through a deeper level of transformation for which there will be no good or honest record. That\u2019s really how it started.  It\u2019s desiring to be present and functioning as a journalist at a time when we would see major freedoms be violated, a whole set of new restrictions being put in place and how you would live through this and how you would write about it \u2014 this is really what we wanted to do. The major challenge that we are working through right now is the block. In 2017, the government started anonymously blocking a small number of websites, which [has] eventually grow[n] to reach over 500 websites at this point, and one of the first ones to blocked was ours. How to generate mirror sites and how to make sure that people can access the information that we worked really hard on, that\u2019s our main challenge.  We also have some financial challenges. Due to the block, the loss of advertisement also meant the loss of other potential sources of revenue. That\u2019s how we were dealt with.  The blocking of the website is quite paralysing. It doesn\u2019t end your operation, but it puts you in a situation that requires needing to work around the problem.  More broadly, I feel concerned about how they will get to us, how bad it will be and what kind of price we will pay.  It was living with that fear and, at the same time, not letting it get in the way of producing and working and not resisting interesting stories, even if they put you at risk. That, I would say, is the main one. Otherwise, all other pressure is in very indirect ways.  We\u2019ve been \u2014 indirectly \u2014 asked about people who are being arrested, [who have] contributed [for us in the past]. So it\u2019s very indirect, they make you feel that they are present but haven\u2019t done anything yet. But the short answer is that the block has really been the main pressure, nothing else really. Exactly, the fact that we seem to be living in a state where there is zero tolerance for dissidence, in ways that I hadn\u2019t experienced even before the revolution, during the other authoritarian regime that preceded the present one.  It\u2019s this idea that everybody is getting picked up, everybody around us, like the circle is tightening and tightening. I feel like we\u2019re the only media out there still able to do something, or at least one of the very few remaining.  However, we are the biggest in terms of the information and the volume of work. It\u2019s like, being alone and isolated in a context that continues to send you a message every day that there is zero tolerance, but for some reason you are still there; somehow, you\u2019re still left. So it makes you question, when will my turn be?  We started a membership programme to capitalise on the idea that people should be paying for good information. So we have a membership club. To join, you can pay according to one of seven tiers, depending on your abilities, and in return you get additional services.  We never put the content behind a paywall. The content remains free, but if you become a member, you get some add-ons in the shape of services and products.  We have some editorial services, both unsolicited and solicited. The unsolicited ones, they are up for subscriptions, so people subscribe and pay for a morning digest that we produce every day. We also have an events platform; we try to organise ticketed events from which we can get some revenue. That\u2019s mainly how we run.  That\u2019s what I meant when I said compromising. If there\u2019s a story I have and it\u2019s well-served, especially if it\u2019s very sensitive and it\u2019s very well-served in terms of evidence, in terms of sourcing, in terms of making it very hard to, in prosecution processes, be accused, we don't question \u2014 we just publish.  The idea is not to publish just anything, to make it seem like we are blindly brave. We are negotiators, we play politics, but the rule for me is if the story is well-served then there is no argument. It has happened in the past and, yes, it was scary and everything, but I never questioned if it was the right decision to publish. Military stuff. So, talking about the military institution, pinpointing their practices, hinting at corruption, that\u2019s the thing that irks them the most.  I would say primarily the entire security institution, the military and the intelligence. When we do stories about them, it gets attention and they don\u2019t like it. I feel that when we started, it was a moment of polarisation between the military and the Islamists. It was hard to gain traction from beyond the very traditional circle of supporters for our project. Liberal leftists, in the Western sense, people who were part of the 2011 revolution. It\u2019s really that contingency, and I think what happened with time is the subsiding of the polarisation and the military takeover.  The fact that people have been saying that we have been producing simple, professional content and that it is not trying to push this or that ideology made us gain more ground, it made us gain more mainstream audiences who are not necessarily pro-revolution or leftist, but need information and there is no other source of information, so they come to us. We\u2019ve been gaining more mainstream audiences over the years and I think that\u2019s an interesting development. Right now, it\u2019s a very fractured environment, in the sense that we have a few surviving veteran state-media which have no influence whatsoever. They have very outdated forms of production, not to mention complete control by the state.  In parallel, we have very few surviving privately-owned media that have either been recently acquired directly by the intelligence or continue to be dependent on the state and intelligence but completely aligning themselves to the authorities in order to be able to survive, because otherwise they won\u2019t be able to.  Then we have the third stream; these are the very few websites, like ours, that tried to be completely independent, that don\u2019t have the same sort of outreach that the mainstream media has, but are somewhat surviving and giving out a different kind of information. It has been the dynamic for some time, but recently there has been more attention directed towards the English media because the state doesn\u2019t like the embarrassment it brings when it enters international circles. So we\u2019ve had situations where the Cairo bureau chief of the   [Declan Walsh, previously the  \u2019 Islamabad bureau chief,   from Pakistan in 2013] was summoned and interrogated. His predecessor was   altogether.  So there is more attention paid towards the English-speaking media, specifically the international media, just because of how they can embarrass our regime, which likes to maintain a polite picture of a modern reformist in front of the Western world in particular. That makes the English media more relevant. Media-wise, the whole region is subscribing to the global media crisis. Even the established media  that are traditionally freer, traditionally more professional, in Lebanon [for example], are facing a major crisis right now, be it political or financial, and are shutting down.  There is a crisis everywhere; I don\u2019t think that Egypt is in a better position. I don\u2019t really know who is in a better position.  You obviously are not trying to compare us with places that are completely conflict-ridden like Yemen, Libya or Syria. So in a context of comparison with other countries where we don\u2019t have war, we are equally in a terrible place, more or less, where we have a few reformist voices that are trying to push the boundaries, and then the big, mainstream beacons of traditional media that are losing their influence more and more.

Assembling data gathered by eight radio telescopes around the world, astronomers created the picture showing the violent neighborhood around a supermassive black hole, the light-sucking monsters of the universe theorized by Einstein more than a century ago and confirmed by observations for decades.  It looked like a flaming orange, yellow and black ring.  \u201cWe have seen what we thought was unseeable. We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole. Here it is,\u201d said Sheperd Doeleman of Harvard.  Read:  Jessica Dempsey, a co-discoverer and deputy director of the East Asian Observatory in Hawaii, said it reminded her of the powerful flaming Eye of Sauron from the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy.  Unlike smaller black holes that come from collapsed stars, supermassive black holes are mysterious in origin. Situated at the center of most galaxies, including ours, they are so dense that nothing, not even light, can escape their gravitational pull.  This one's \u201cevent horizon\u201d the point of no return around it, where light and matter begin to fall inexorably into the abyss is as big as our entire solar system.  Three years ago, scientists using an extraordinarily sensitive observing system heard the sound of two much smaller black holes merging to create a gravitational wave, as Albert Einstein predicted.  The new image, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters and announced around the world in several news conferences, adds light to that sound.  Outside scientists suggested the achievement could be worthy of a Nobel Prize, just like the gravitational wave discovery.  While much around a black hole falls into a death spiral and is never to be seen again, the new image captures \u201clucky gas and dust\u201d circling at just far enough to be safe and seen millions of years later on Earth, Dempsey said.  Taken over four days when astronomers had \u201cto have the perfect weather all across the world and literally all the stars had to align,\u201d the image helps confirm Einstein's general relativity theory, Dempsey said.  Einstein a century ago even predicted the symmetrical shape that scientists just found, she said. \n\u201cIt's circular, but on one side the light is brighter,\u201d Dempsey said.  That's because that light is approaching Earth.  The measurements are taken at a wavelength the human eye cannot see, so the astronomers added color to the image. They chose \u201cexquisite gold because this light is so hot,\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cMaking it these warm gold and oranges makes sense.\u201d  What the image shows is gas heated to millions of degrees by the friction of ever-stronger gravity, scientists said.  And that gravity creates a funhouse effect where you see light from both behind the black hole and behind you as the light curves and circles around the black hole itself, said astronomer Avi Loeb, director of the Black Hole Initiative at Harvard. (The lead scientists in the discovery are from Harvard, but Loeb was not involved.)  \t\t\t The project cost $50 million to $60 million, with $26 million of that coming from the National Science Foundation.  Johns Hopkins astrophysicist Ethan Vishniac, who was not part of the discovery team but edits the journal where the research was published, pronounced the image \u201can amazing technical achievement\u201d that \u201cgives us a glimpse of gravity in its most extreme manifestation.\u201d  He added: \u201cPictures from computer simulations can be very pretty, but there's literally nothing like a picture of the real universe, however fuzzy and monochromatic.\u201d  \u201cIt's just seriously cool,\u201d said John Kormendy, a University of Texas astronomer who wasn't part of the discovery team. \u201cTo see the stuff going down the tubes, so to speak, to see it firsthand.  The mystique of black holes in the community is very substantial. That mystique is going to be made more real.\u201d  There is a myth that says a black hole would rip you apart, but Loeb and Kormendy said the one pictured is so big, someone could fall into it and not be torn to pieces. But the person would never be seen from again.  Black holes are \u201clike the walls of a prison. Once you cross it, you will never be able to get out and you will never be able to communicate,\u201d Loeb said.  The first image is of a black hole in a galaxy called M87 that is about 53 million light years from Earth. One light year is 5.9 trillion miles, or 9.5 trillion kilometers. This black hole is about 6 billion times the mass of our sun.  The telescope data was gathered by the Event Horizon Telescope two years ago, but it took so long to complete the image because it was a massive undertaking, involving about 200 scientists, supercomputers and hundreds of terabytes of data delivered worldwide by plane.  The team looked at two supermassive black holes, the M87 and the one at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy.

But the group stage also introduced the world to several vibrant young talents set to dominate cricket for years to come. Here,   looks at five players who have announced their arrival as potential stars:  Nicolas Pooran finally showcased the talent he has promised to unleash for so long as the batsman finished as the West Indies' leading run scorer. \t\t\t The 23-year-old made a duck on his ODI debut before the World Cup but went on to play each of the team's nine group games, scoring 367 runs at an average of 52.42. West Indies assistant coach Roddy Estwick had seen Pooran's potential five years ago when he scored 143 in an Under-19 World Cup match against Australia. \u201cI've always believed in Nicholas. I'm not surprised by his talent. What's surprised me is it's taken as long as this for him to come through,\u201d Estwick said. Pakistan paceman Shaheen Shah Afridi enjoyed a breakthrough World Cup campaign, prompting Wasim Akram to hail the teenager as a future star. \t\t\t The teenager recorded Pakistan's best-ever World Cup bowling figures with a scintillating spell of 6-35 in Friday's win over Bangladesh at Lord's. He became the youngest player to take a five-wicket haul at the World Cup at 19 years and 90 days, finishing the tournament with 16 wickets in five games. \u201cDefinitely, Shaheen is one for the future, a beacon of light for the next generation of fast bowlers,\u201d Wasim told  . Afghanistan may have left the World Cup winless after losing all nine matches, but the minnows could take heart from the rise of teenage off-spinner Mujeebur Rahman. \t\t\t Mujeeb took just seven wickets in the tournament, but the 18-year-old tormented batsmen with his crafty use of flight and variation, marking him out as one to watch. Rashid Khan, his senior by two years, remains Afghanistan's number one spinner, but Mujeeb is coming up fast, as he proved with a superb spell of 3-39 against Bangladesh in Southampton. When Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne reflected on a frustrating campaign for the 1996 champions, the promising form of fearless batsman Avishka Fernando put a smile back on his face. \t\t\t The 21-year-old scored 203 runs in only four matches in the tournament, including 104 against the West Indies and 49 in Sri Lanka's shock win over England. \u201cWe've had a few positives out of this World Cup,\u201d Karunaratne said. \u201cAvishka Fernando is playing really well. \u201cHe showed what he can do, he can produce runs for Sri Lanka. He's one of the future stars.\u201d  Barbados-born Jofra Archer has repaid England's faith with a dazzling breakthrough in his first major tournament. \t\t\t Archer only became eligible to play for England earlier this year and was fast-tracked into the team just before the World Cup in a bid to make the most of the paceman's natural gifts. The 24-year-old's combination of speed and accuracy made him unplayable at times. He taken 17 wickets in England's run to the semi-finals, including a run of four successive three-wicket hauls, leading many to mark him down as the spearhead of his country's attack for years to come.", "category": "Sport"},

Stokes was stripped of the role in 2017 following a late-night brawl in Bristol but was restored as Joe Root\u2019s deputy ahead of the five-Test series against Australia.  Jos Buttler had been acting as Root\u2019s right-hand man but was happy to pass the baton back after England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) director of men\u2019s cricket Ashley Giles and chief executive Tom Harrison recommended Stokes\u2019s restoration.  Speaking on a weekend visit to his old club in Cumbria, the 28-year-old said: \u201cI love having that responsibility and it is something that I thoroughly enjoy doing. I take pride in being vice-captain. Being part of that think-tank is pretty cool.  \u201cI am very good friends with Joe as well, off the field, and as much as I can do to help him through his career, not just as a captain but as a player as well, I am really looking forward to that challenge.  \u201cI think it would have been just as exciting anyway. Playing in an Ashes series is always special and they don\u2019t come around that often but being named vice-captain again was very good words to hear when I got the call.\u201d   Stokes missed the last series against Australia in 2017-18 after he was stood down by the ECB following events in Bristol.  He will start the Ashes campaign buoyed by his man-of-the-match performance in the World Cup final but is now switching focus.  \u201cEverything is sort of on the Ashes now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had that time to let everything sink in and reflect on that amazing seven weeks we have had in the World Cup, but the World Cup was half of the journey that we wanted to achieve this summer and the other half is winning the Ashes.  \u201cEverything has been focused on what we are going to do to beat the Australians.

Walker ", "Canada"], "content": "BRUMADINHO: Grief over the hundreds of Brazilians feared killed in last week\u2019s mining disaster has quickly hardened into anger as victims\u2019 families and politicians say iron ore miner Vale SA and regulators have learned nothing from the recent past. By Monday, firefighters in the state of Minas Gerais had confirmed 60 people dead in  , in which a tailings dam broke sending a torrent of sludge into the miner\u2019s offices and the town of Brumadinho. Nearly 300 other people are unaccounted for, and officials said it was unlikely that any would be found alive. Shares of Vale, the world\u2019s largest iron ore and nickel producer, plummeted 21.5 per cent in Monday trading on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, erasing $16 billion in market cap. Brazil\u2019s top prosecutor, Raquel Do\u00ad\u00addge, said the company should be held strongly responsible and criminally prosecuted. Executives could also be personally held responsible, she said. Brazil\u2019s Vice-President Hamilton Mourao, who is acting president since Monday morning when Jair Bolso\u00adnaro underwent surgery, also said the government needs to punish those responsible for the dam disaster. In a tweet, Brazilian Senator Re\u00ad\u00adnan Calheiros asked Justice Minister Sergio Moro \u201chow many people should die before federal police changes Vale management, before key evidence disappears.\u201d Moro is a previous judge in charge of Brazil\u2019s largest-ever corruption probe. One of Vale\u2019s lawyers, Sergio Bermudes, told newspaper Folha de S. Paulo that the executives should not leave the company and that Calheiros was trying to profit politically from the tragedy. Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said during a visit to Brumadinho on Sunday that facilities there were built to code and equipment had shown the dam was stable two weeks earlier. The disaster at the Corrego do Feijao mine occurred less than four years after a dam collapsed at a nearby mine run by Samarco Mineracao SA, a joint venture by Vale and BHP Billiton , killing 19 and filling a major river with toxic sludge. While the 2015 Samarco disaster dumped about five times more mining waste, Friday\u2019s dam break was far deadlier, as the wall of mud hit Vale\u2019s local offices, including a crowded cafeteria, and tore through a populated area downhill. Many wondered if the state of Minas Gerais, named for the mining industry that has shaped its landscape for centuries, should have higher standards. \u201cThere are safe ways of mining,\u201d said Joao Vitor Xavier, head of the mining and energy commission in the state assembly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it diminishes profit margins, so they prefer to do things the cheaper way and put lives at risk.\u201d  Reaction to the disaster could threaten the plans of Brazil\u2019s newly inaugurated president to relax restrictions on the mining industry, including proposals to open up indigenous reservations and large swathes of the Amazon jungle for mining.", "category": "Archive"},

Now, after years of brutal attacks and mass desertions from similar checkpoints, the Afghan government is acting on long-standing American requests to close them.  The aim is to shutter outposts where troops are often left like sitting ducks for Taliban attackers and consolidate them onto larger bases \u2500 several of which are under construction.  The plan is for troops to lead offensive missions, taking the fight to the Taliban instead of trying to survive day-to-day in often deplorable living conditions with little outside support.  The \u201ccheckpoint is a failed tactic\u201d, Dadan Lawang, an Afghan army general, said recently at a US base in Paktia province, south of Kabul.  Some 50 per cent of military casualties occur at checkpoints, he said, a grim number considering tens of thousands of Afghan troops have been killed or wounded since the end of 2014 \u2500 losses the massively depleted Afghan military can ill afford.  \"We want to draw down all those checkpoints and establish strong bases now,\" Lawang told  . \nThe idea of closing checkpoints has been taboo in Afghan politics for years.  A tiny fort flying the black-red-and-green national flag sends a message that the government holds an area, and Afghan politics is built on a patchwork of alliances with regional power brokers, many of them in remote places.  \"To maintain an alliance sufficient to remain in office... the president of Afghanistan has often preferred to push troops out into locations that make no military sense but are politically important,\" said Stephen Biddle, a professor at Columbia University in New York who has written extensively about Afghanistan.  US Army Brigadier General Kevin Admiral, who heads the US military's Task Force Southeast, said it was challenging to finally change the Afghan military's view.  \"They have a lot of political pressure at the local level with district governors and parliamentarians who have said this is our only visible representation of (the government) in these remote areas,\" he said.  For General Scott Miller, who leads Nato's Afghanistan mission and the US war effort in the country, the closure of checkpoints is crucial for the Afghan military.  \"They don't lose people in (offensive) operations, they kill Taliban,\" Miller told US military officials at a recent meeting. \"You want to hear my (tactical) priorities? Talk about checkpoints.\"  To hammer his message, Miller makes frequent trips across Afghanistan, bringing local military commanders to show them troops' living conditions.  On a visit to the Wardak checkpoint last week, Miller said he wanted to open Afghan commanders' eyes to the perilousness of such outposts.  The scruffy camp, where troops sleep in converted shipping containers with smashed windows, is a short distance from Highway 1 \u2500 a key route for sending goods and supplies into Kabul and around the country.  But despite its strategic location, troops at the checkpoint and others like it often go without regular food or pay because of mismanagement and corruption. And if an attack does come, back up may never arrive.  On Miller's visit, US snipers and soldiers secured the isolated facility's perimeter and one Afghan soldier complained to his higher ups about not having been paid for three months.  Asadullah Khalid, Afghanistan's acting defence minister, blamed a documentation issue and said it would be fixed.  His staff dished out several $100 bills to soldiers from a wad that Khalid said was a gift for Eid. \"I want to make sure that everyone sitting on a checkpoint gets a paycheck and food,\" Miller told  . \"t's a leadership issue. These are things we take for granted.\" While critics agree Afghan checkpoints have little tactical value, they differ over whether withdrawing troops to bases will make them more willing to fight.  Closing checkpoints \"essentially cedes ground to the Taliban and gets the (Afghan security forces) onto larger bases, where they often hunker down,\" said Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington.  But Colonel David Butler, a US military spokesman in Kabul, said Afghan troops \"are doing more independent operations and are more effective during those operations.\"", "category": "World"},

The African country has been facing turbulence ever since long-time strongman Omar al-Bashir was forced to step down in April by the military after 30 years in power; the generals took the step after popular protests against his rule refused to abate. The former president himself was a field marshal who, along with other army men, had overthrown the elected government of Sadiq al-Mahdi in a 1989 coup. The latest developments might have been welcomed, but clearly the goal should be total democracy without interference from unelected quarters. Indeed, the protesters have put up a brave fight for representative rule, and given many lives in the last few months. One particularly savage assault by paramilitary forces took place in early June, in which soldiers reportedly fired live rounds at demonstrators. The sacrifices of the Sudanese people must not be in vain, and the newly formed sovereign council must pave the way for an elected government that is answerable to the people. While Sudan continues on the long and winding road towards representative rule, other Arab states are not faring well. For example, Egypt, the country\u2019s northern neighbour, is firmly in the grip of the military establishment after the hopes raised by the Arab Spring were shattered with Mohamed Morsi\u2019s ouster. Elsewhere in the region, kings and sheikhs with absolute power lord it over the people, while strongmen and \u2018presidents for life\u2019 offer a fig leaf of democracy, but rule with an iron fist. Clearly, the Arab Spring showed that the people of the Middle East want change \u2014 principally democratic rule, an end to corruption and the assurance of fundamental rights. Yet these dreams remain unrealised. Of course, democratic rule must be an organic, internal process as democracy cannot be \u2018imported\u2019. The rulers of regional states must realise that their young populations are yearning for more, and unless they open up their political systems, further turmoil will be the result in the long run. Unfortunately, many global actors who swear by democratic values \u2014 the US and Europe, for example \u2014 are quite comfortable dealing with the region\u2019s strongmen and potentates, and have rarely offered moral support for democratic movements. This has only emboldened Arab autocrats over the decades.", "category": "Archive"},

There was a brief period, after parliamentary elections in late 2011, when street dissent seemed on the rise, and large rallies gripped Moscow. The optimism dissipated however, after Putin won another resounding victory in the March 2012 presidential elections. The day before his inauguration, a huge protest turned violent. In a sign that any radicalisation would not be tolerated, a number of protesters were put on trial, often for extremely minor offences, and threatened with years in jail. Since then, the opposition\u2019s mood has been on the wane, with urban liberals either making plans to leave Russia or simply getting on with life, feeling they have more to lose than to gain by protesting. Russia\u2019s parliament is dominated by the pro-Putin United Russia party but also has three parties nominally in opposition: Just Russia, the Liberal Democrats and the Communists. While these parties are given airtime on television and \u2014 especially in the case of the Communists \u2014 have a genuine electorate, they are best described as \u201csystemic opposition\u201d, managed by the Kremlin. Among the \u201cnon-systemic\u201d opposition, there are a few politicians who have much of a national profile, with the restrictions of state television meaning it is hard to gain a real platform. Harassment, threats and fatigue have led many into either jail or exile. Now that Nemtsov has been silenced, here is a list of the main opposition figureheads. Once Russia\u2019s richest man, Khodorkovsky was jailed in 2003, on charges widely believed to be politically motivated after he began financing political parties. He spent a decade in jail but was released in December 2013 after Putin granted him amnesty. Khodorkovsky was immediately flown to Berlin and now lives in Zurich. In December, he told the Guardian he believes he will be arrested if he returns to Russia. He has set up the Open Russia Foundation and said he is prepared to go \u201call the way\u201d to change the regime in Russia. However, although Khodorkovsky may have impressed some with his stoical handling of a decade in prison, most Russians have little regard for those who made billions in the 1990s, and it is also unclear how much he can influence politics from outside the country. The former world chess champion became a fierce critic of Putin and was a frequent fixture at opposition events for many years, often being detained by police.  In 2013, he announced at a press conference in Geneva that he had decided not to return to Russia, as after criminal charges were brought against Navalny and other opposition activists, he could be next. A blogger and lawyer who gained a huge following for his investigations into corruption among Putin\u2019s elite, Navalny came to prominence during the wave of street protests in Moscow at the end of 2011, and was widely seen as the brightest hope for the opposition. Some are disturbed by his Russian nationalist views while others point out that they could help him gain broader support among Russians who would not normally support the opposition. Since he came to prominence, Navalny has had to deal with a wave of bureaucratic and legal hassles, including two major court cases. At the end of last year, Navalny was given a suspended sentence in a fraud trial, but his brother was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Navalny says authorities have effectively taken his brother hostage in an attempt to stop him working but he has vowed to continue. He was not at Sunday\u2019s march in Moscow, having been jailed for 15 days when handing out leaflets advertising the event \u2014 back when it was still an \u201canti-crisis rally\u201d and not a memorial for Nemtsov. It has been suggested for a long time that the serious popular threat to Putin comes not from liberals but from nationalists, and these forces have been newly invigorated by the war in east Ukraine. Indeed, one theory is that rogue nationalist groups could be behind the killing of Nemtsov. Strelkov, a fan of military re-enactments, fought for Russia in Chechnya and more recently helped coordinate the pro-Russian rebel movement in eastern Ukraine. Called back to Moscow after apparently going rogue, he has said he believes Russia will soon be engulfed by war. \u201cHis analysis is simple,\u201d said Alexander Borodai, another Russian leader of the Donbass rebels. \u201cThere is a crisis in the country, the government will fall soon, and in the inevitable civil war, Igor Strelkov will head patriotic forces and become the dictator of what is left of Russia.\u201d The scenario seems unlikely but there is no doubt that serious thought is being given as to whether the promotion of Russian nationalism in the armed conflict in Ukraine might have let a genie out of the bottle. A familiar face at opposition protests for years, 38-year-old Udaltsov is a hard-core radical leftist, who has been detained on numerous occasions at rallies. He was charged as part of the \u201cmass disturbances\u201d case over a May 2012 rally that turned violent, and was sentenced to four-and-a-half-year imprisonment.  From jail, he has said that liberals and leftists must go separate ways now, due to their different positions on the conflict in Ukraine, and while he still opposes Putin, he calls for a new union of far-left forces.", "category": "Archive"},

Excellent"], "content": "THE debate about religion and science dates back centuries. The debate is not about a technical matter, but about two realms of knowledge \u2014 theological and scientific. There seems to be an epistemological clash of validity between the two, apparently with each claiming sway over human life. Faith leaders or ulema, in general, boast of having a godly system, which is eternally true, free from error and change. They underplay the hand of man in the understanding, interpretation and application of religious dogmas. Religious leaders are known to oppose scientific developments that they interpret as opposing the key notions of religion due largely to the fear that these would undermine the faith of believers. They may do it with sincerity to religion, and presumably, to save believers from error. Their tools to deny science are theological and based largely on discursive reason, and not necessarily empirical evidence. They do not always have at their disposal the modern tools of understanding religion, such as scientific history of religions, sociology, psychology, anthropology etc. Reza Aslan\u2019s work God: a Human History is illuminating; it explores how the evolution of religious impulses has taken place in the history of humankind. Scientists on the other hand, see science as a realm of knowledge strongly reliable, based on human reason and demonstrable empirical evidence. For them, it is a self-corrective and evolving project, modifying itself, and following new evidence through inductive experimentation. It is an approach to generating and judging knowledge. The debate between religion and science leaves us with no common ground. A religious mindset on the other hand, sees this changing nature of scientific discoveries as a weakness, boasting of perennial and unchanging \u2018truths\u2019. It prefers stability over change; it is dogma-based. In almost all religions, historically opposition to science and scientists has been proverbial, leading to prejudices against, and torture of, scientists, as they are seen as \u2018perverted\u2019 souls, hell-bent on defying religious dogmas. This happens often because they use theological criteria to judge science; it is exactly like scientists judging religion or spirituality based on their experimental approach. The debate between religion and science, put simply, leaves us with no common ground. I, for one argue that the epistemological approaches (forms of knowing and their validity criteria) to both religion and science need to be treated differently as they require different ways of establishing (methodology) and judging (criteria of truth) knowledge and truth claims. We need to be sophisticated enough to see these differences so that we understand each through its own perspective, avoiding one criterion for judging both. Each branch of science requires different methodologies to study it. Similarly, within religion each branch requires different methodologies of study such as law or spirituality, language or ritual. Thus, when the ulema judge science using theology, they inevitably make the same mistake as those scientists who judge religion using the scientific method. So, it is necessary that we treat both of them differently, which means we do not downgrade either of them, but acknowledge the unique contribution of each to human welfare.  In my lectures and visits to international audiences, I am always asked by young people the fashionable question: \u2018What contribution has religion made to human progress in the last 500 years?\u2019 This is obviously done keeping the magnificent scientific contributions at the back of their mind. I argue, \u2018What contributions could one expect from religion to make?\u2019 Did we expect religion to make a technological revolution?  By nature, what science does can be seen and observed; but the transformation brought about by religion in the inner core of people is invisible. However, though exceptional civilisational achievements might have been possible thanks to scientists, it is impossible to ignore the religious \u2018faith\u2019 impulse within, and the spiritual inspiration behind for example, civilisational art and architectural marvels, and literary jewels. It is unfair to expect religion to bring, say, a super technological revolution. The major purpose of religion is to not to make technological advances, but to carry out \u2018inner engineering\u2019, and transformations, and make people virtuous. In sum, let us avoid rejecting a scientific approach to solving human problems at the altar of religion; nor should we reject religion because it does not work like science. Let us celebrate both as they address different dimensions of human yearning equally. As the Quran (2:201), says, \u201c...Our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter. ...\u201d. So we seek the best of both religion and science. Let the ulema become a bridge between the two.", "category": "\u2018Out, damn\u2019d spot! Out\u2019\n"},

According to a statement issued by the embassy on the occasion: \"A large number of guests attended the event and had a first-hand experience of the taste, juiciness and aroma of the famous Pakistani mangoes as well as   made from the famous Pakistani   rice.\" Key political figures, fruit importers, diplomats and media representatives attended the event. The festival included fresh mango and mango cuts as well as a wide range of mango delicacies such as mango milkshake, mango lassi, mango ice cream, mango salad, mango souffl\u00e9, mango mousse, mango pudding, and mango cake.  Selected Pakistani music lent further festivity to the occasion. As part of the event, a photographic display of Pakistan's natural beauty was also included. Welcoming the guests, Pakistan Ambassador to Turkey M Syrus Sajjad Qazi said that Pakistan is the 5th largest producer and the 6th largest exporter of mangoes.  \u201cWe Pakistanis call mango the \u2018king of fruits\u2019 and it is among the sweetest fruits on the face of the earth,\u201d the Ambassador said.  \u201cChaunsa is the most popular variety \u2014 and we are serving the White Chaunsa today,\u201d the Ambassador said, as he addressed a sizable audience.  He hoped that such events will soon allow the availability of Pakistani mangoes to lovers of the fruit in Turkey. Ambassador Qazi also spoke of the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Turkey and remarked that \"there could be no better way to celebrate the friendship between the two countries than with the king of fruits \u2014 the Pakistani mango.\" A lucky draw also formed part of the festivities in which five guests won a box of mangoes each. \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t", "category": "SMOKERS\u2019 CORNER: \u2018MANGO DIPLOMACY\u2019\n"},

This means a relatively higher proportion of the country\u2019s educated workers is sitting at home hoping to find a decent job. Students dream about enrolling in top-tier universities because they believe that those institutions are their gateway to well-paid jobs and professional success. Unfortunately, only a handful of institutions across all fields of study can truly groom their students. So the problem of most varsities being under par is a severe one. Top business schools are considered a ticket to an executive job in any top corporation. This is due to the fact that these schools recognise the needs of the market and develop their students accordingly. The courses they offer, the curriculum they teach, the quality of their faculty and their contact base are such that their students don\u2019t have a hard time finding jobs. The quality of coursework and the faculty in universities are severely under par  Even though there some business schools that are working hard to achieve the top local standard, most schools are still at rock bottom. The quality of their coursework and faculty, their enrolment criteria and the average student profile are severely under par. Obsolete textbooks, lack of substantial research and students technically bribing their institutions to get their degrees are common. In science as well, only a handful of universities produce quality doctors and engineers. Graduates from most medical schools are unskilled and lack confidence to actually deal with a patient. That is because too much theoretical teaching takes place at medical schools without any emphasis on practical work.  Similarly, we often hear jokes about unemployed engineers. Despite being a distinguished field globally, engineering does not get the respect it deserves in Pakistan. That is so because too many universities produce too many engineers even though their demand is limited owing to Pakistan\u2019s underdeveloped industrial base. Lots of schools have a low merit criterion. So it\u2019s easy for anyone to enrol, which raises the supply of potential engineers. Many engineering schools lack advanced labs with relevant instruments. They are theoretical in their teaching and students are encouraged to learn by rote. That is why such students struggle to find a decent job in the local market. Most graduates from middle-class or lower-class households can\u2019t afford to go abroad to find jobs as the local market is too saturated. They can\u2019t afford to live or even study abroad. They often can\u2019t fulfil immigration requirements of developed countries. Students of social sciences and humanities face the worst prospects. As few organisations in Pakistan are interested in research, such graduates suffer the most. Most of them get employment in academia. But even there, supply exceeds demand. Of late, however, some corporations have started hiring psychology specialists as HR executives. Some psychologists open their clinics. But their businesses don\u2019t generally do well because of the negative perception about seeking mental health in our society. The Higher Education Commission (HEC) is the regulatory body for all universities in Pakistan. It is its responsibility to make sure the quality of university education is up to par. The HEC is trying to push institutions to recruit more PhDs as faculty members. According to Employers\u2019 Federation of Pakistan Chairman Majyd Aziz, faculty members do not have the exposure to trade and industry. \u201cThey are normally fresh graduates who teach through PowerPoint presentations made through textbooks. They are unable to back their teaching with practical experience. Universities should send their faculty members to the industry for three to six months on a voluntary basis. This will give them practical knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cPakistan needs proficient managers, not hopeless drones with degrees.\u201d Shazia Farooq, a visiting faculty member at the Institute of Business Administration, said that students should enhance their skills through Massive Open Online Courses, which are available online for free. \u201cStudents should also improve their work ethic and attitude. They should be more willing to put in extra hours since supply is becoming increasingly elastic,\u201d she said. ", "category": "Humble beginnings\n"},

{"title": "How ", "image_urls": ["https://i.dawn.com/primary/2019/07/5d2d714cef266.jpg"], "published_date": " July 16, 2019", "updated_date": [], "authors": ["Jahanzeb Hussain"], "tweets": [], "comments": [], "content": "\"The goal of journalism to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comforted and to give voice to the voiceless, is one that guides us in what we cover, how we cover it and who we speak to,\" states the mission statement of  , a well-known Arabic and English online journalism platform from Egypt. In a depressing human rights landscape in that country and the region overall,   shines bright as one of the few beacons of hope.  The independent publication was founded in Cairo by a group of young journalists six years ago. I met up with  \u2019s co-founder and chief editor   in Germany at the Kultur Symposium last month. We spoke about the birth of the publication, the pressures it faces from the Egyptian authorities and how Lina manages to run the operation in a testing environment; an environment that journalists in Pakistan may relate to.  The interview below has been edited for clarity. In 2013, a group of journalists and I were working for a big media company, and there came a point when they didn\u2019t want us to work for them anymore.  It was also the year when there were mass protests against the elected Islamist government [in Egypt] that eventually led to a takeover by the military, which continues to rule the country up until this moment.  So when we were shown the door by this media company, there was no other option for us to continue doing what we were doing except that if we created our own institution. At the same time, we sensed the urgency because we felt that the country was going through a deeper level of transformation for which there will be no good or honest record. That\u2019s really how it started.  It\u2019s desiring to be present and functioning as a journalist at a time when we would see major freedoms be violated, a whole set of new restrictions being put in place and how you would live through this and how you would write about it \u2014 this is really what we wanted to do. The major challenge that we are working through right now is the block. In 2017, the government started anonymously blocking a small number of websites, which [has] eventually grow[n] to reach over 500 websites at this point, and one of the first ones to blocked was ours. How to generate mirror sites and how to make sure that people can access the information that we worked really hard on, that\u2019s our main challenge.  We also have some financial challenges. Due to the block, the loss of advertisement also meant the loss of other potential sources of revenue. That\u2019s how we were dealt with.  The blocking of the website is quite paralysing. It doesn\u2019t end your operation, but it puts you in a situation that requires needing to work around the problem.  More broadly, I feel concerned about how they will get to us, how bad it will be and what kind of price we will pay.  It was living with that fear and, at the same time, not letting it get in the way of producing and working and not resisting interesting stories, even if they put you at risk. That, I would say, is the main one. Otherwise, all other pressure is in very indirect ways.  We\u2019ve been \u2014 indirectly \u2014 asked about people who are being arrested, [who have] contributed [for us in the past]. So it\u2019s very indirect, they make you feel that they are present but haven\u2019t done anything yet. But the short answer is that the block has really been the main pressure, nothing else really. Exactly, the fact that we seem to be living in a state where there is zero tolerance for dissidence, in ways that I hadn\u2019t experienced even before the revolution, during the other authoritarian regime that preceded the present one.  It\u2019s this idea that everybody is getting picked up, everybody around us, like the circle is tightening and tightening. I feel like we\u2019re the only media out there still able to do something, or at least one of the very few remaining.  However, we are the biggest in terms of the information and the volume of work. It\u2019s like, being alone and isolated in a context that continues to send you a message every day that there is zero tolerance, but for some reason you are still there; somehow, you\u2019re still left. So it makes you question, when will my turn be?  We started a membership programme to capitalise on the idea that people should be paying for good information. So we have a membership club. To join, you can pay according to one of seven tiers, depending on your abilities, and in return you get additional services.  We never put the content behind a paywall. The content remains free, but if you become a member, you get some add-ons in the shape of services and products.  We have some editorial services, both unsolicited and solicited. The unsolicited ones, they are up for subscriptions, so people subscribe and pay for a morning digest that we produce every day. We also have an events platform; we try to organise ticketed events from which we can get some revenue. That\u2019s mainly how we run.  That\u2019s what I meant when I said compromising. If there\u2019s a story I have and it\u2019s well-served, especially if it\u2019s very sensitive and it\u2019s very well-served in terms of evidence, in terms of sourcing, in terms of making it very hard to, in prosecution processes, be accused, we don't question \u2014 we just publish.  The idea is not to publish just anything, to make it seem like we are blindly brave. We are negotiators, we play politics, but the rule for me is if the story is well-served then there is no argument. It has happened in the past and, yes, it was scary and everything, but I never questioned if it was the right decision to publish. Military stuff. So, talking about the military institution, pinpointing their practices, hinting at corruption, that\u2019s the thing that irks them the most.  I would say primarily the entire security institution, the military and the intelligence. When we do stories about them, it gets attention and they don\u2019t like it. I feel that when we started, it was a moment of polarisation between the military and the Islamists. It was hard to gain traction from beyond the very traditional circle of supporters for our project. Liberal leftists, in the Western sense, people who were part of the 2011 revolution. It\u2019s really that contingency, and I think what happened with time is the subsiding of the polarisation and the military takeover.  The fact that people have been saying that we have been producing simple, professional content and that it is not trying to push this or that ideology made us gain more ground, it made us gain more mainstream audiences who are not necessarily pro-revolution or leftist, but need information and there is no other source of information, so they come to us. We\u2019ve been gaining more mainstream audiences over the years and I think that\u2019s an interesting development. Right now, it\u2019s a very fractured environment, in the sense that we have a few surviving veteran state-media which have no influence whatsoever. They have very outdated forms of production, not to mention complete control by the state.  In parallel, we have very few surviving privately-owned media that have either been recently acquired directly by the intelligence or continue to be dependent on the state and intelligence but completely aligning themselves to the authorities in order to be able to survive, because otherwise they won\u2019t be able to.  Then we have the third stream; these are the very few websites, like ours, that tried to be completely independent, that don\u2019t have the same sort of outreach that the mainstream media has, but are somewhat surviving and giving out a different kind of information. It has been the dynamic for some time, but recently there has been more attention directed towards the English media because the state doesn\u2019t like the embarrassment it brings when it enters international circles. So we\u2019ve had situations where the Cairo bureau chief of the   [Declan Walsh, previously the  \u2019 Islamabad bureau chief,   from Pakistan in 2013] was summoned and interrogated. His predecessor was   altogether.  So there is more attention paid towards the English-speaking media, specifically the international media, just because of how they can embarrass our regime, which likes to maintain a polite picture of a modern reformist in front of the Western world in particular. That makes the English media more relevant. Media-wise, the whole region is subscribing to the global media crisis. Even the established media  that are traditionally freer, traditionally more professional, in Lebanon [for example], are facing a major crisis right now, be it political or financial, and are shutting down.  There is a crisis everywhere; I don\u2019t think that Egypt is in a better position. I don\u2019t really know who is in a better position.  You obviously are not trying to compare us with places that are completely conflict-ridden like Yemen, Libya or Syria. So in a context of comparison with other countries where we don\u2019t have war, we are equally in a terrible place, more or less, where we have a few reformist voices that are trying to push the boundaries, and then the big, mainstream beacons of traditional media that are losing their influence more and more.

But the group stage also introduced the world to several vibrant young talents set to dominate cricket for years to come. Here,   looks at five players who have announced their arrival as potential stars:  Nicolas Pooran finally showcased the talent he has promised to unleash for so long as the batsman finished as the West Indies' leading run scorer. \t\t\t The 23-year-old made a duck on his ODI debut before the World Cup but went on to play each of the team's nine group games, scoring 367 runs at an average of 52.42. West Indies assistant coach Roddy Estwick had seen Pooran's potential five years ago when he scored 143 in an Under-19 World Cup match against Australia. \u201cI've always believed in Nicholas. I'm not surprised by his talent. What's surprised me is it's taken as long as this for him to come through,\u201d Estwick said. Pakistan paceman Shaheen Shah Afridi enjoyed a breakthrough World Cup campaign, prompting Wasim Akram to hail the teenager as a future star. \t\t\t The teenager recorded Pakistan's best-ever World Cup bowling figures with a scintillating spell of 6-35 in Friday's win over Bangladesh at Lord's. He became the youngest player to take a five-wicket haul at the World Cup at 19 years and 90 days, finishing the tournament with 16 wickets in five games. \u201cDefinitely, Shaheen is one for the future, a beacon of light for the next generation of fast bowlers,\u201d Wasim told  . Afghanistan may have left the World Cup winless after losing all nine matches, but the minnows could take heart from the rise of teenage off-spinner Mujeebur Rahman. \t\t\t Mujeeb took just seven wickets in the tournament, but the 18-year-old tormented batsmen with his crafty use of flight and variation, marking him out as one to watch. Rashid Khan, his senior by two years, remains Afghanistan's number one spinner, but Mujeeb is coming up fast, as he proved with a superb spell of 3-39 against Bangladesh in Southampton. When Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne reflected on a frustrating campaign for the 1996 champions, the promising form of fearless batsman Avishka Fernando put a smile back on his face. \t\t\t The 21-year-old scored 203 runs in only four matches in the tournament, including 104 against the West Indies and 49 in Sri Lanka's shock win over England. \u201cWe've had a few positives out of this World Cup,\u201d Karunaratne said. \u201cAvishka Fernando is playing really well. \u201cHe showed what he can do, he can produce runs for Sri Lanka. He's one of the future stars.\u201d  Barbados-born Jofra Archer has repaid England's faith with a dazzling breakthrough in his first major tournament. \t\t\t Archer only became eligible to play for England earlier this year and was fast-tracked into the team just before the World Cup in a bid to make the most of the paceman's natural gifts. The 24-year-old's combination of speed and accuracy made him unplayable at times. He taken 17 wickets in England's run to the semi-finals, including a run of four successive three-wicket hauls, leading many to mark him down as the spearhead of his country's attack for years to come.", "category": "India search for a coach good at man-management, planning\n"},

But it continued in USA till the start of the 20 th century. So its multifactorial in origin,economics being the major one these days."], "content": "Some of the earliest well-known incidents of mob violence fueled by extreme religious sentiments occurred in the late 17th century in the town of Salem.  Salem is situated in present-day Massachusetts in the US. The area was a British colony at the time. Over a dozen people, mostly women, were accused by the town\u2019s people of indulging in witchcraft. They were soon mobbed before being arrested and then executed.  The frenzy was sparked by the publication of a book by a Latitudinarian Christian writer and Puritan, Joseph Glanville.  Published in 1663, the book claimed that a denial in the belief of spirits and demons was a denial of belief in Christianity. Glanville tried to prove the existence of witches and demons. It must be added that \u2018witch-burnings\u2019 had already taken place across Europe before the epidemic reached Salem.  Well-known American medievalist and writer, Sandra Mielsel, wrote in an article   that witch-hunts were largely the outcome of theological and even economic tensions between different Christian sects. In the same essay she wrote that witch-burnings by mobs were often facilitated by judges and government officials.  However, by the 18th century, mob violence triggered by religious beliefs came to an end. The Salem incident is important because as historian, George L. Burr, wrote in his 1914 book  : \u201cThe Salem witch-hunt was the rock on which theocracy shattered.\u201d Burr was suggesting that such events across Europe and in Salem triggered a backlash against theology and monarchism and heralded epochs such as the \u2018Age of Reason\u2019 and/or the \u2018Age of Enlightenment\u2019 \u2014 18th century movements in Europe which promoted intellectual, social and economic progress through reason, science, tolerance and democracy. Even though from the 18th century onwards, violent mobs driven by religious sentiments vanished from Europe and the US, mob violence did not.  The ideological motivation behind such mobs changed. It mutated from being religious to becoming racial or ethnic.  In fact, in a reversal of fortunes, during the late 18th century French Revolution, mobs even attacked the churches. In the United States, race riots involving white mobs attacking blacks became common across the 19th and 20th centuries. While mob violence driven by religious sentiments was withering away in Europe, it was emerging in South Asia \u2014 a region which is now considered to be a hotbed of religiously-motivated mob frenzies.  All the chief academic sources which are used to document this region\u2019s history speak very little of any major religiously-motivated mob action before the 19th century. In a 2016 feature in Germany\u2019s academic journal, Springer, historian Sunthar Visuvalingam places the emergence of religiously-motivated mob-violence in South Asia in 1809, in the city of Banaras.  Hindu and Muslim mobs began to attack members and properties of each other\u2019s communities over the felling of a pillar considered sacred by the Hindus. According to Visuvalingam, before 1809, there is no mention of religiously-motivated mob action in the region.  This incident took place during a period when the 500-year-old Muslim rule in India was collapsing and British colonialists were consolidating their dominance in India. It was in the 1920s that religiously-motivated mob violence emerged in the region in a much fuller manner.  So much so that in 1919, Muslim leader (and future founder of Pakistan), Muhammad Ali Jinnah wrote a letter to his Hindu counterpart, Mahatma Gandhi, in which he warned that the Muslim and Hindu communities should be kept away from religious movements because such movements would unleash untapped violent emotions that could destroy them both. By the 1940s, Hindu, Sikh and Muslim mobs were attacking the perceived enemies of their respective faiths, a phenomenon which began being called \u2018communal violence.\u2019  This violence continues to haunt India \u2014 now more than ever \u2014 despite the creation of Muslim-majority Pakistan in 1947. In Pakistan, only two major incidents of religiously-motivated mob violence took place between 1947 and 1981. Both were against the Ahmadiyya community (1953 and 1974).  The 1953 mobs were crushed by the military while the 1974 ones led to the constitutional ouster of the community from the fold of Islam. Mob frenzies driven by religious motivations saw a manifold increase in the 1980s, mainly involving \u2018sectarian strife\u2019 between the country\u2019s Sunni majority and Shia minority.  In the 1980s the country\u2019s Blasphemy Laws had also been strengthened. From 1990, incidents of mobs falling upon alleged blasphemers saw a drastic increase. Interestingly, the whole concept of such a law was first introduced by British colonialists in India in 1860, as the intensity of polemical treatises between Hindus and Muslims grew.  This law was further strengthened in 1927, during an increase in Hindu-Muslim riots. Pakistan adopted this law as is in 1947 but it was never made an important part of the 1956 and the 1962 constitutions or in the initial version of the 1973 constitution. Till 1990, only 14 people were accused of committing blasphemy.  The number of accusations and mob attacks on alleged blasphemers saw an almost tenfold increase after additional clauses were introduced by the Zia regime in the 1980s. Various theories have explained religiously-motivated mob violence.  Renowned psycho-analyst Sigmund Freud and psychologist William Dougall described mobs as \u2018primordial hordes\u2019 led by \u2018horde leaders\u2019 who exploit simplistic emotions about faith found in the masses.  To Freud, the mob mindset could be addressed by neutralising horde leaders. This can be done by encouraging the pursuit of individuality among citizens. Professor Phillip G. Zimbardo believes that participating in mob violence frees the participant \u2018from the necessity of normal social behaviour\u2019 because personal controls such as guilt, shame and self-evaluating behaviour dissolves in a charged crowd. American psychologist, F. Hennery Allport suggested that mobs are comprised of like-minded individuals who get the chance to express their beliefs in a more intensified manner than they would in more normal circumstances. Violent impulses associated with one\u2019s idea of morality and faith which are rejected and discouraged in a more rational and controlled setting, come alive in mobs.", "category": "Pakistan"},

Authorities were evacuating several neighbourhoods in the southeastern city of Brumadinho that were within range of the B6 dam owned by the Brazilian mining company Vale. There was no immediate word on how many people were evacuated. \u201cLeave here, this is at risk!\u201d police officials told firefighters in a lower-lying area. \u201cWithin a little while, more mud will fall.\u201d  The firefighters had been working to extract a cow found alive in the mud, but they pulled back on the order of police, leaving the animal. \t\t\t\t\t\t While the ground search was stopped, helicopters continued to fly over the area, possibly so they would not be hit if another collapse happened. Caroline Steifeld, who was evacuated, said she heard warning sirens on Sunday, but no such alert came on Friday, when the first dam collapsed. \u201cI only heard shouting, people saying to get out. I had to run with my family to get to higher ground, but there was no siren,\u201d she said, adding that a cousin was still unaccounted for. Even before the latest setbacks, hope that loved ones had survived a tsunami of iron ore mine waste from Friday's dam collapse in the area was turning to anguish and anger over the increasing likelihood that many of the hundreds of people missing had died. Company employees at the mining complex were eating lunch on Friday afternoon when the first dam gave way. By Saturday night, when authorities called off rescue efforts until daybreak, the dam break toll stood at 40 dead with up to 300 people estimated to be missing. All day Saturday, helicopters flew low over areas encased by a river of mud and mining waste as firefighters dug frantically to get into buried structures. \u201cI'm angry. There is no way I can stay calm,\u201d said Sonia Fatima da Silva, as she tried to get information about her son, who had worked at Vale for 20 years. \u201cMy hope is that they be honest. I want news, even if it's bad.\u201d Da Silva said she last spoke to her son before he went to work on Friday, when around midday a dam holding back mine waste collapsed, sending waves of mud for kilometres (miles) and burying much in its path. She was one of scores of relatives in Brumadinho who desperately awaited word on their loved ones.  Romeu Zema, the governor of Minas Gerais state, said by now most recovery efforts will entail pulling out bodies. The flow of waste reached the nearby community of Vila Ferteco and an occupied Vale administrative office. It buried buildings to their rooftops and an extensive field of the mud cut off roads. Some residents barely escaped with their lives. \u201cI saw all the mud coming down the hill, snapping the trees as it descended. It was a tremendous noise,\u201d said a tearful Simone Pedrosa, from the neighbourhood of Parque Cachoeira, 5 miles (8 kilometres) from where the dam collapsed. Pedrosa, 45, and her parents dashed to their car and drove to the highest point in the neighbourhood. \u201cIf we had gone down the other direction, we would have died,\u201d Pedrosa said. \u201cI cannot get that noise out of my head,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a trauma ... I'll never forget.\u201d  In addition to the 40 bodies recovered as of Saturday night, 23 people were hospitalised, according to the Minas Gerais fire department.  There had been some signs of hope earlier on Saturday when authorities found 43 more people alive. The company said on Saturday that while 100 workers were accounted for, more than 200 workers were still missing.  Fire officials at one point estimated the total number at close to 300. \t\t\t Vale CEO Fabio Schvartsman said he did not know what caused the collapse. For many, hope was evaporating. \u201cI don't think he is alive,\u201d said Joao Bosco, speaking of his cousin, Jorge Luis Ferreira, who worked for Vale.  \u201cRight now, I can only hope for a miracle.\u201d  Vanilza Sueli Oliveira described the wait for news of her nephew as \u201cdistressing, maddening.\u201d \u201cTime is passing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's been 24 hours already. ... I just don't want to think that he is under the mud.\u201d  The rivers of mining waste also raised fears of widespread environmental contamination and degradation. According to Vale's website, the waste, often called tailings, is composed mostly of sand and is non-toxic.  However, a UN report found that the waste from a similar disaster in 2015 \u201ccontained high levels of toxic heavy metals.\u201d  Over the weekend, state courts and the justice ministry in the state of Minas Gerais froze about $1.5 billion from Vale assets for state emergency services and told the company to report on how they would help the victims. Brazil's Attorney General Raquel Dodge promised to investigate the mining dam collapse, saying \u201csomeone is definitely at fault.\u201d Dodge noted there are 600 mines in the state of Minas Gerais alone that are classified as being at risk of rupture. Another dam administered by Vale and Australian mining company BHP Billiton collapsed in 2015 in the city of Mariana in the same state of Minas Gerais, resulting in 19 deaths and forcing hundreds from their homes.  Considered the worst environmental disaster in Brazilian history, it left 250,000 people without drinking water and killed thousands of fish. An estimated 60 million cubic metres of waste flooded nearby rivers and eventually flowed into the Atlantic Ocean. Sueli de Oliveira Costa, who hadn't heard from her husband since Friday, had harsh words for the mining company. \u201cVale destroyed Mariana and now they've destroyed Brumadinho,\u201d she said. The   newspaper reported on Saturday that the dam's mining complex was issued an expedited license to expand in December due to \u201cdecreased risk.\u201d Conservation groups in the area alleged that the approval was unlawful. \t\t\t\t\t\t On Twitter, new Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said his government would do everything it could to \u201cprevent more tragedies\u201d like Mariana and now Brumadinho. The far-right leader campaigned on promises to jump-start Brazil's economy, in part by deregulating mining and other industries. Environmental groups and activists said the latest spill underscored the lack of environmental regulation in Brazil, and many promised to fight any further deregulation. Marina Silva, a former environmental minister and presidential candidate, toured the area on Sunday. She said such tragedies should be deemed \u201cheinous crimes,\u201d and that Congress should bear part of the blame for not toughening regulations and enforcement. \u201cAll the warnings have been given. We are repeating history with this tragedy,\u201d she told  . \n\u201cBrazil can't become a specialist in rescuing victims and consoling widows. Measures need to be taken to avoid prevent this from happening again.\u201d ", "category": "World"},

The post in Wardak province west of Kabul has been hit before, and its sagging blast walls and teetering sandbags make clear the vulnerability of the 13 troops living there for weeks on end.  Now, after years of brutal attacks and mass desertions from similar checkpoints, the Afghan government is acting on long-standing American requests to close them.  The aim is to shutter outposts where troops are often left like sitting ducks for Taliban attackers and consolidate them onto larger bases \u2500 several of which are under construction.  The plan is for troops to lead offensive missions, taking the fight to the Taliban instead of trying to survive day-to-day in often deplorable living conditions with little outside support.  The \u201ccheckpoint is a failed tactic\u201d, Dadan Lawang, an Afghan army general, said recently at a US base in Paktia province, south of Kabul.  Some 50 per cent of military casualties occur at checkpoints, he said, a grim number considering tens of thousands of Afghan troops have been killed or wounded since the end of 2014 \u2500 losses the massively depleted Afghan military can ill afford.  \"We want to draw down all those checkpoints and establish strong bases now,\" Lawang told  . \nThe idea of closing checkpoints has been taboo in Afghan politics for years.  A tiny fort flying the black-red-and-green national flag sends a message that the government holds an area, and Afghan politics is built on a patchwork of alliances with regional power brokers, many of them in remote places.  \"To maintain an alliance sufficient to remain in office... the president of Afghanistan has often preferred to push troops out into locations that make no military sense but are politically important,\" said Stephen Biddle, a professor at Columbia University in New York who has written extensively about Afghanistan.  US Army Brigadier General Kevin Admiral, who heads the US military's Task Force Southeast, said it was challenging to finally change the Afghan military's view.  \"They have a lot of political pressure at the local level with district governors and parliamentarians who have said this is our only visible representation of (the government) in these remote areas,\" he said.  For General Scott Miller, who leads Nato's Afghanistan mission and the US war effort in the country, the closure of checkpoints is crucial for the Afghan military.  \"They don't lose people in (offensive) operations, they kill Taliban,\" Miller told US military officials at a recent meeting. \"You want to hear my (tactical) priorities? Talk about checkpoints.\"  To hammer his message, Miller makes frequent trips across Afghanistan, bringing local military commanders to show them troops' living conditions.  On a visit to the Wardak checkpoint last week, Miller said he wanted to open Afghan commanders' eyes to the perilousness of such outposts.  The scruffy camp, where troops sleep in converted shipping containers with smashed windows, is a short distance from Highway 1 \u2500 a key route for sending goods and supplies into Kabul and around the country.  But despite its strategic location, troops at the checkpoint and others like it often go without regular food or pay because of mismanagement and corruption. And if an attack does come, back up may never arrive.  On Miller's visit, US snipers and soldiers secured the isolated facility's perimeter and one Afghan soldier complained to his higher ups about not having been paid for three months.  Asadullah Khalid, Afghanistan's acting defence minister, blamed a documentation issue and said it would be fixed.  His staff dished out several $100 bills to soldiers from a wad that Khalid said was a gift for Eid. \"I want to make sure that everyone sitting on a checkpoint gets a paycheck and food,\" Miller told  . \"t's a leadership issue. These are things we take for granted.\" While critics agree Afghan checkpoints have little tactical value, they differ over whether withdrawing troops to bases will make them more willing to fight.  Closing checkpoints \"essentially cedes ground to the Taliban and gets the (Afghan security forces) onto larger bases, where they often hunker down,\" said Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington.  But Colonel David Butler, a US military spokesman in Kabul, said Afghan troops \"are doing more independent operations and are more effective during those operations.\"", "category": "Outrage mounts in India over rape case teen's suspicious car crash\n"}[

Navalny was hospitalised following what was described as an acute allergic reaction, but his supporters later said they believed he had been exposed to poison. \u201cIt is indeed poisoning by some unknown chemical substance,\u201d his lawyer Olga Mikhailova told reporters Monday outside Moscow\u2019s hospital No 64, which treated Navalny. Navalny on Sunday had swollen eyelids, discharge in the eye and a rash on his upper body, his personal physician Anastasia Vasilyeva said. She told reporters on Monday that both she and the 43-year-old politician believe the reaction could have been a response to \u201csome chemical agent\u201d. Navalny has been in jail since last week for calling an unauthorised rally. Vasilyeva said doctors at the hospital diagnosed him with a skin condition, adding that he had improved after being treated with a steroid. But he has been sent back to jail despite needing to continue the treatment, she said, raising concerns over the danger to his health in prison and the possibility that his cell could be contaminated.

Vasilyeva is an ophthalmologist who had treated Navalny previously after he nearly lost the sight in one eye after an attack in 2017. He has never suffered from allergies in the past, she said.

The manager of the local Al Jomhouri hospital said 13 people were killed and 23 injured in air strikes in Qatabir district by a Saudi-led coalition battling the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen.   said the death toll had risen to 14. The coalition spokesman accused the Houthis of attacking the market but did not specify the type of assault or confirm the number killed. \u201cThe attack carried out by the Houthis on Al Thabet market is a terrorist act to spite Yemenis and the tribes of Al Thabet,\u201d Colonel Turki al-Malki said in a statement, adding that the tribes were against the group. Pictures taken by a photographer showed more than nine bodies, some of them torn apart, lined up on a nylon sheet near the morgue. \u201cThere are two children among the martyrs and 11 children among those injured,\u201d hospital manager Saleh Qorban said. Masirah later said four children were killed. Saudi Arabia is leading the Western-backed alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognised government, which was ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in late 2014. The movement has stepped up missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities, and the coalition has responded with air strikes on Houthi targets, mostly around Sanaa. In August 2018, coalition air strikes killed dozens of people, including children travelling on a bus through a market in Saada. The alliance initially said it had targeted missile launchers but later admitted that the attack was unjustified. Human rights groups have criticised Western countries that provide arms and intelligence to the coalition over air strikes that have killed civilians at hospitals, schools and markets. The coalition says it does not intentionally target civilians. The four-year-old war, that has killed tens of thousands and pushed the long-impoverished Arabian Penin\u00adsula nation to the brink of famine, has long been in a military stalemate. The Houthis, who say their revolution is against corruption, control Sanaa and most of the main urban centres. The government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi holds the southern port of Aden. The violence could complicate efforts to implement a U.N.- sponsored troop withdrawal agreement in the main port city of Hodeidah that is meant to pave the way for peace talks to end the conflict, which is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "category": "Archive"},

Police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators in Bilad al-Qadeem suburb where one protester died from gas inhalation on Saturday, four activists said. A government spokesperson said in a statement that the man died from natural causes. People also took to the streets in several Shia villages and neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the capital Manama on Sunday night in response to Saturday\u2019s execution of Ali al-Arab and Ahmed al-Malali, who were sentenced to death last year on terrorism crimes in a mass trial. Videos and pictures posted on verified social media accounts of activists showed demonstrators clashing with security forces, burning ties and building roadblocks. The protests are the most significant unrest in more than two years in the island state, headquarters of the US Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, since authorities in 2017 executed three Shia men convicted of killing three policemen in a bomb attack. Bahrain has a Shia majority and is ruled by a Sunni royal family. It is the only one of the Gulf monarchies to have faced serious unrest during the Arab Spring protests that swept the Middle East and North Africa in 2011. Asked about the demonstrations, the government spokesperson said that Bahrain upholds constitutional rights for freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, but \u201cany acts of disorder that disrupt public safety require legal actions to be taken\u201d in accordance with internationally recognised standards. The ruling Al Khalifa family has kept a lid on dissent since the mostly Shia opposition staged a failed uprising in 2011. Saudi Arabia sent in troops to help crush that unrest in a mark of concern that any major unrest or power-sharing concession by Bahrain could inspire its own Shia minority. Activists abroad have called for further protests over the executions, which were criticised by international rights groups who say the men\u2019s confessions were obtained through torture, which Manama denies. \u201cThere are calls and there will be more protests in the coming days, but the repression is very violent and authorities are retaliating with collective punishments,\u201d said Ali Alaswad, a senior member of the dissolved opposition group al-Wefaq, who has lived in exile in London since 2011. Bahrain has closed the main opposition groups and prosecuted scores of people, stripping hundreds of their nationalities, in mass trials. A number of activists have fled abroad. Many Bahrainis say they are deprived of jobs and treated as second class citizens in the country of 1.5 million. Authorities deny this and accuse Iran of fostering unrest that has seen demonstrators clash with security forces, who have been targeted by several bomb attacks. Tehran denies involvement. Analysts say they do not expect a repeat of past widespread violence given measures to stifle dissent in Bahrain, which has been emboldened by a crackdown on dissent in Saudi Arabia. \u201cBahrainis know an escalation, as happened in 2011, will not only be met with brutality, but also with the occupation by Saudi Forces in the form of the Gulf Peninsula Shield,\u201d said Marc Owen Jones of the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter, referring to a common Gulf Arab force. On Sunday, hundreds of people attended the funeral of Mohammad Ibrahim al-Mokdad, 22, who died after taking part in Saturday night\u2019s protest. The government spokesperson said a medical report \u201cconfirms illness as cause of death\u201d. \u201cWith our souls, with our blood, we will redeem you, martyr,\u201d mourners could be heard chanting in several videos of the funeral posted on activists\u2019 social media accounts. Many were holding pictures of the executed activists, who were among three men executed on Saturday. Authorities said, without identifying any of the men, that they were convicted in two separate cases, one involving the killing of a police officer and the other the killing of a mosque imam. London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy says that 17 people are currently on death row on political grounds, including eight at imminent risk of execution. \u201cThe regime uses executions as a vengeance tool,\u201d said al-Wefaq\u2019s Alaswad.

Power supply was suspended with the first drop of rain in the morning. Many city areas even remained without electricity for over 15 hours. Due to the intensity of the rain, the Sindh government announced that all public and private educational institutions across the province wotuld remain closed on Tuesday (today).   The Pakistan Metrological Department warned that the trend was likely to continue on Tuesday. The pre-dawn downpour continued till late in the evening and the Met Office recorded 69.4 millimetres, or 2.73 inches, of rain till 8pm. The Met observatories recorded 69.4mm of rain in Surjani Town; PAF Faisal Base and its surrounding areas (66mm or 2.59 inches); Airport (50.4mm or 1.98 inches); North Karachi (55.6mm or 2.18 inches); Gulistan-i-Jauhar (50mm or 1.96 inches); PAF Base Masroor (45mm or 1.77 inches) and 32mm, or 1.25 inches, of rain was recorded in Landhi and its neighbouring areas. Schools, colleges across Sindh closed today; city gets 69mm rain till 8pm \u201cThe much-awaited rain system entered Sindh early in the morning,\u201d said the city\u2019s weatherman Sardar Sarfaraz. \u201cDue to climate factors the system landed a little late in the region but since it\u2019s here we are expecting moderate to heavy rains in the city to continue for the next 24 to 36 hours.\u201d He said that there were two systems currently circulating in the region \u2014 one in the Arabian Sea and the other in the Bay of Bengal.  \t\t\t The rain badly affected the traffic in the city, where hours-long traffic jams were witnessed on key roads. The traffic started slowing mainly in the second half of the day when the downpour turned stronger and took hours to normalise amid non-functioning of several traffic signals, absence of traffic officials and blockade of some major roads due to accumulation of rainwater. In district South, hundreds of vehicles were stuck in a traffic mess on I.I. Chundrigar Road, M.R. Kayani Road, Sarwar Shaheed Road, Abdullah Haroon Road, Napier Road, Hasrat Mohani Road, Burnes Road, Shahrah-i-Liaquat, Saddar and Sharea Faisal. Officials said the rain badly affected two key links of East district \u2014 Korangi Causeway and Korangi Road \u2014 which link Korangi with the rest of the city, as people opted for alternative routes which further swelled the number of vehicles on available arteries.  The vehicular traffic on roads along Liaquatabad, some blocks of Nazimabad, a few sectors in North Karachi and parts of Shahrah-i-Pakistan remained slow but kept moving after the alternative system to drain the rainwater was installed by authorities. In East district, University Road remained the worst-hit area where hundreds of vehicles were seen lined up after sunset due to accumulated rainwater. Similarly, in Central district construction works on key traffic intersections made the situation difficult for vehicular traffic. The rain also affected the air traffic as many flights from Karachi to different destinations were cancelled due to weather conditions. A spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines said that eight flights from Karachi to Sukkur, Karachi-Gwadar, Karachi-Multan and Sukkur-Islamabad had been cancelled. He said that all measures had been taken in view of the forecast of heavy rains in the city and passengers were being provided with help at the airport in case of delays/cancellation or diversion of their flights. A CAA official said that in all eight flights were cancelled and four were delayed due to rain in Karachi. \t\t\t With the first few drops of rain, the power supply system in the city failed to prove its effectiveness.  The K-Electric blamed \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cheavy rain\u201d for prolonged power failures that extended up to 15 hours in many areas in the city till 11pm. In the evening, the KE claimed to have restored power supply in most parts of the city, but residents from different localities called Dawn offices to share their sufferings due to hours-long power breakdowns even after 11pm. \u201cUnprecedented and heavy rains disrupted power supply to some areas in Korangi, Landhi, Lyari and Bin Qasim,\u201d said the power utility. \u201cThe K-Electric\u2019s rapid response teams are in the field, working swiftly to restore power to all affected areas.\u201d It said: \u201cPower supply to parts of Jail Chowrangi, Gulshan, Nazimabad, Gizri, PNT Colony, Numaish, Punjab Chowrangi and Garden has already been restored. In [a] few cases, power supply to kunda-infested and low-laying areas has been deliberately turned off as a safety precaution to avoid any serious incident. Inconvenience is regretted.\u201d   The local and provincial governments came under criticism over poor response during the rain. However, Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said: \u201cKey roads of the city which always got submerged after rains are not in that bad condition this time. We are only facing challenges in a few areas where drainage system is not capable to handle this amount of rain. But we are going for alternative solutions, which would improve the situation in next few hours.\u201d Meanwhile, the Sindh government announced holiday for educational institutions on Tuesday due to intermittent and continued rains. \u201cThere would be a public holiday for educational institutes, both public and private, across Sindh province on Tuesday because of continued rains,\u201d said Education Secretary Qazi Shahid Pervez.", "category": "Pakistan"},

Imran Khan\u2019s personal Banigala residence is all set to receive some form of permanent regulatory approval. Malik Riaz will facilitate the PTI\u2019s Naya Pakistan Housing Programme, constructing new housing units in Rawalpindi/Islamabad. These are in no particular order; nevertheless, there has to be some logic to these decisions. Sea Breeze was originally constructed as a medical facility, which was subsequently misused. The building\u2019s occupants now say they are willing to hand it over; demolishing it, however, would directly affect at least 200 traders. And, of course, only Malik Riaz can build thousands of new housing units and deliver them in time. But what else ties these decisions together? That naya Pakistan is not a country for most of its own people. That executive, legislative, judicial and regulatory capture is now complete. Let me explain. \u2018Naya\u2019 Pakistan is just \u2018purana\u2019 Pakistan on steroids. At least 12,000 Karachiites lost their homes, shops, and other spaces as part of the demolition drive ordered by the Supreme Court. They included people who had valid permits from various government offices. Some were in Empress Market, while many were unfortunate enough to live or conduct business along the Karachi Circular Railway track. Nothing in their plight \u2014 stories of despondency, destruction, and even death \u2014 could move any authority to deliver any form of relief. In the ill-informed and undue haste to \u2018restore\u2019 Karachi, we brought thousands of the urban poor to the streets. But of course, the 200 Sea Breeze traders had a different kind of access. The story is similar in Islamabad. An ongoing demolition drive against khokhas has rendered hundreds jobless; why should we care that most were validly licensed to operate? By one count, around 500 khokhas were established after obtaining due permits from competent authorities. For years, they provided critical local needs of food, water, and a place to hang out in poor settlements and other areas with low commercial activity where formal restaurateurs wouldn\u2019t venture. But, of course, a raging messiah quickly realised that Islamabad\u2019s master plan didn\u2019t permit the poor to eat. However, did the same master plan allow for Imran Khan\u2019s palatial mansion in Banigala? Never mind that the prime minister lives there! Ironically, Mr Khan\u2019s own petitions in judicial forums have led to the demolition of dozens of buildings in Banigala, driving out his poorer neighbours even as his own mansion looks forward to some form of regularisation. Master plans are always problematic. They reflect economic and political power structures without catering to the most downtrodden; on top is the wanton disregard in which the elite hold them. Khokhas and jhuggis, on the other hand, are poor families\u2019 way out from their exclusion from master plans. This explains both the Banigala mansion and the appearance of slums and khokhas in Pakistan\u2019s \u2018only\u2019 planned city. Regularisation is thus not the problem. Instead, the question is: who gets what? Twelve thousand poor traders and slum dwellers can go to hell but not 200; 500 khokhas can be demolished but not one man\u2019s palace. Refugees and migrants can be brutally evicted from informal settlements in Islamabad, but the same state can do nothing about senators occupying educational institutions\u2019 lands in the heart of the same city. In fact, why not go even further and link a pro-poor housing project with the country\u2019s biggest private encroacher in history (as established by the court)? We\u2019re driving out the urban poor from their \u2018encroachments\u2019 even as the government validates and further strengthens criminals. To rub salt into our wounds, our messiahs cite economic miseries to raise taxes, hike utility tariffs for the poorest, and reduce or eliminate subsidies even on critical facilities like urban transit. Alongside, and in a parallel reality where our coffers are bursting at the seams, come the daftest policy moves \u2014 like the stock market bailout. When you have too much money, a market controlled by the most powerful few deserves more public billions than a transit system used by hundreds of thousands of people a day. There are countless other examples. Only recently, we had the luggage plastic wrap fiasco. Can we not speculate that the regulator and executive both connived to invent a way for a blue-eyed bigot to make some money? And so what? Remember corporate tax cuts? Go back to purana Pakistan, and remember IPPs with billions of dollars in committed capacity payments?  This naya Pakistan is just purana Pakistan on steroids: those who can, get their way; those who can\u2019t, get kicked; and political and judicial leaders continue to act oblivious to the plight of the people. Purana woe was us. Naya woe is us. And, for that, woe to our messiahs, and woe to us for so eagerly selecting them.", "category": "Archive"}[

Authorities announced a night-time curfew in four towns following the deaths in the central town of Al-Obeid, as a key protest group called for nationwide rallies against the \u201cmassacre\u201d. The ruling military council and protest leaders earlier this month inked a power-sharing deal providing for a joint civilian-military administration which in turn would install civilian rule. That is the main demand of a nationwide protest movement that led to the April ouster of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir and has since demanded that the generals who took his place cede power to civilians. But on the eve of Tuesday\u2019s talks aimed at resolving outstanding issues over the transition, five protesters were killed in Al-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan state, said a doctors\u2019 committee linked to the protest movement. \u201cFive martyrs succumbed to direct wounds from sniper bullets during a peaceful rally in Al-Obeid,\u201d the committee said in a statement. Prominent protest leader Babikir Faisal said that the dead included \u201cfour high school students\u201d. Al-Obeid residents and a local journalist also confirmed that the dead included high schoolers. A key protest group, the Sudanese Professionals Association, said \u201clive ammunition\u201d had been used against a \u201crally of school students\u201d. In a post on its Facebook page, it urged \u201call citizens and medics\u201d to head to hospitals treating the wounded. In a separate statement, it called for nationwide protests against the \u201cmassacre,\u201d demanding that \u201cthe perpetrators be brought to justice\u201d. Hundreds of protesters later rallied in Khartoum\u2019s two districts of Bahri and Burri, but they were swiftly confronted by riot police who fired tear gas, witnesses said. The office of North Kordofan\u2019s governor announced an overnight curfew in four towns including Al-Obeid, starting Monday and continuing indefinitely. It added that all schools in the province had been told to suspend classes. Residents of Al-Obeid said the rally had been over a shortage of bread and fuel in the town. It was a sudden tripling of bread prices that initially triggered December protests against Bashir, which later turned into a nationwide movement against his three-decade rule. \u201cFor the past few days there has been a shortage of fuel and bread,\u201d an Al-Obeid resident said. \u201cSchool children were affected as there is no transport to help them reach their schools. Today, they staged a rally and when it reached downtown there were shots fired.\u201d The town had not previously witnessed major rallies against Bashir even as provinces, cities and towns were swept up by the campaign against his rule. Monday\u2019s deaths sparked calls for talks set for Tuesday to be suspended. \u201cWe cannot sit at the negotiating table with those allowing the killing of revolutionaries,\u201d Siddig Youssef, a prominent protest leader, said in a statement. Tuesday\u2019s talks were set to cover issues including the powers of the joint civilian-military ruling body, the deployment of security forces and immunity for generals over protest-related violence, according to protest leaders. The power-sharing deal agreed on July 17 provided for the establishment of a new governing body of six civilians and five generals. It was then to oversee the formation of a transitional civilian government and parliament to govern for 39 months, followed by elections.", "category": "Archive"},

Navalny was hospitalised following what was described as an acute allergic reaction, but his supporters later said they believed he had been exposed to poison. \u201cIt is indeed poisoning by some unknown chemical substance,\u201d his lawyer Olga Mikhailova told reporters Monday outside Moscow\u2019s hospital No 64, which treated Navalny. Navalny on Sunday had swollen eyelids, discharge in the eye and a rash on his upper body, his personal physician Anastasia Vasilyeva said. She told reporters on Monday that both she and the 43-year-old politician believe the reaction could have been a response to \u201csome chemical agent\u201d. Navalny has been in jail since last week for calling an unauthorised rally. Vasilyeva said doctors at the hospital diagnosed him with a skin condition, adding that he had improved after being treated with a steroid. But he has been sent back to jail despite needing to continue the treatment, she said, raising concerns over the danger to his health in prison and the possibility that his cell could be contaminated. A senior doctor at the hospital told reporters that Navalny\u2019s health was not under threat. But Vasilyeva accused the hospital doctors of not wanting to find out what caused Navalny\u2019s condition. \u201cAlexei has been clearly sent back to the detention centre on orders from above,\u201d she said. Vasilyeva is an ophthalmologist who had treated Navalny previously after he nearly lost the sight in one eye after an attack in 2017. He has never suffered from allergies in the past, she said. The Russian opposition leader is serving a 30-day jail sentence for calling Saturday\u2019s rally after authorities blocked prominent independent candidates from taking part in Moscow parliament elections in September.

The manager of the local Al Jomhouri hospital said 13 people were killed and 23 injured in air strikes in Qatabir district by a Saudi-led coalition battling the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen.   said the death toll had risen to 14. The coalition spokesman accused the Houthis of attacking the market but did not specify the type of assault or confirm the number killed. \u201cThe attack carried out by the Houthis on Al Thabet market is a terrorist act to spite Yemenis and the tribes of Al Thabet,\u201d Colonel Turki al-Malki said in a statement, adding that the tribes were against the group. Pictures taken by a photographer showed more than nine bodies, some of them torn apart, lined up on a nylon sheet near the morgue. \u201cThere are two children among the martyrs and 11 children among those injured,\u201d hospital manager Saleh Qorban said. Masirah later said four children were killed. Saudi Arabia is leading the Western-backed alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognised government, which was ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in late 2014. The movement has stepped up missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities, and the coalition has responded with air strikes on Houthi targets, mostly around Sanaa. In August 2018, coalition air strikes killed dozens of people, including children travelling on a bus through a market in Saada. The alliance initially said it had targeted missile launchers but later admitted that the attack was unjustified. Human rights groups have criticised Western countries that provide arms and intelligence to the coalition over air strikes that have killed civilians at hospitals, schools and markets. The coalition says it does not intentionally target civilians. The four-year-old war, that has killed tens of thousands and pushed the long-impoverished Arabian Penin\u00adsula nation to the brink of famine, has long been in a military stalemate. The Houthis, who say their revolution is against corruption, control Sanaa and most of the main urban centres. The government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi holds the southern port of Aden. The violence could complicate efforts to implement a U.N.- sponsored troop withdrawal agreement in the main port city of Hodeidah that is meant to pave the way for peace talks to end the conflict, which is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "category": "Archive"},

I am sorry!  Fair Play?  Democracy?  R I P", "Gordon D. Walker", "Canada"], "content": "DUBAI: Protests broke out in Bahrain after the execution of two opposition activists on terrorism-related charges revived tension over the weekend in the kingdom, a Western ally that has cracked down on dissent since a failed 2011 uprising. Police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators in Bilad al-Qadeem suburb where one protester died from gas inhalation on Saturday, four activists said. A government spokesperson said in a statement that the man died from natural causes. People also took to the streets in several Shia villages and neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the capital Manama on Sunday night in response to Saturday\u2019s execution of Ali al-Arab and Ahmed al-Malali, who were sentenced to death last year on terrorism crimes in a mass trial. Videos and pictures posted on verified social media accounts of activists showed demonstrators clashing with security forces, burning ties and building roadblocks. The protests are the most significant unrest in more than two years in the island state, headquarters of the US Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, since authorities in 2017 executed three Shia men convicted of killing three policemen in a bomb attack. Bahrain has a Shia majority and is ruled by a Sunni royal family. It is the only one of the Gulf monarchies to have faced serious unrest during the Arab Spring protests that swept the Middle East and North Africa in 2011. Asked about the demonstrations, the government spokesperson said that Bahrain upholds constitutional rights for freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, but \u201cany acts of disorder that disrupt public safety require legal actions to be taken\u201d in accordance with internationally recognised standards. The ruling Al Khalifa family has kept a lid on dissent since the mostly Shia opposition staged a failed uprising in 2011. Saudi Arabia sent in troops to help crush that unrest in a mark of concern that any major unrest or power-sharing concession by Bahrain could inspire its own Shia minority. Activists abroad have called for further protests over the executions, which were criticised by international rights groups who say the men\u2019s confessions were obtained through torture, which Manama denies. \u201cThere are calls and there will be more protests in the coming days, but the repression is very violent and authorities are retaliating with collective punishments,\u201d said Ali Alaswad, a senior member of the dissolved opposition group al-Wefaq, who has lived in exile in London since 2011. Bahrain has closed the main opposition groups and prosecuted scores of people, stripping hundreds of their nationalities, in mass trials. A number of activists have fled abroad. Many Bahrainis say they are deprived of jobs and treated as second class citizens in the country of 1.5 million. Authorities deny this and accuse Iran of fostering unrest that has seen demonstrators clash with security forces, who have been targeted by several bomb attacks. Tehran denies involvement. Analysts say they do not expect a repeat of past widespread violence given measures to stifle dissent in Bahrain, which has been emboldened by a crackdown on dissent in Saudi Arabia. \u201cBahrainis know an escalation, as happened in 2011, will not only be met with brutality, but also with the occupation by Saudi Forces in the form of the Gulf Peninsula Shield,\u201d said Marc Owen Jones of the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter, referring to a common Gulf Arab force. On Sunday, hundreds of people attended the funeral of Mohammad Ibrahim al-Mokdad, 22, who died after taking part in Saturday night\u2019s protest. The government spokesperson said a medical report \u201cconfirms illness as cause of death\u201d. \u201cWith our souls, with our blood, we will redeem you, martyr,\u201d mourners could be heard chanting in several videos of the funeral posted on activists\u2019 social media accounts. Many were holding pictures of the executed activists, who were among three men executed on Saturday. Authorities said, without identifying any of the men, that they were convicted in two separate cases, one involving the killing of a police officer and the other the killing of a mosque imam. London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy says that 17 people are currently on death row on political grounds, including eight at imminent risk of execution. \u201cThe regime uses executions as a vengeance tool,\u201d said al-Wefaq\u2019s Alaswad.

Power supply was suspended with the first drop of rain in the morning. Many city areas even remained without electricity for over 15 hours. Due to the intensity of the rain, the Sindh government announced that all public and private educational institutions across the province wotuld remain closed on Tuesday (today).   The Pakistan Metrological Department warned that the trend was likely to continue on Tuesday. The pre-dawn downpour continued till late in the evening and the Met Office recorded 69.4 millimetres, or 2.73 inches, of rain till 8pm. The Met observatories recorded 69.4mm of rain in Surjani Town; PAF Faisal Base and its surrounding areas (66mm or 2.59 inches); Airport (50.4mm or 1.98 inches); North Karachi (55.6mm or 2.18 inches); Gulistan-i-Jauhar (50mm or 1.96 inches); PAF Base Masroor (45mm or 1.77 inches) and 32mm, or 1.25 inches, of rain was recorded in Landhi and its neighbouring areas. Schools, colleges across Sindh closed today; city gets 69mm rain till 8pm \u201cThe much-awaited rain system entered Sindh early in the morning,\u201d said the city\u2019s weatherman Sardar Sarfaraz. \u201cDue to climate factors the system landed a little late in the region but since it\u2019s here we are expecting moderate to heavy rains in the city to continue for the next 24 to 36 hours.\u201d He said that there were two systems currently circulating in the region \u2014 one in the Arabian Sea and the other in the Bay of Bengal.  \t\t\t The rain badly affected the traffic in the city, where hours-long traffic jams were witnessed on key roads. The traffic started slowing mainly in the second half of the day when the downpour turned stronger and took hours to normalise amid non-functioning of several traffic signals, absence of traffic officials and blockade of some major roads due to accumulation of rainwater. In district South, hundreds of vehicles were stuck in a traffic mess on I.I. Chundrigar Road, M.R. Kayani Road, Sarwar Shaheed Road, Abdullah Haroon Road, Napier Road, Hasrat Mohani Road, Burnes Road, Shahrah-i-Liaquat, Saddar and Sharea Faisal. Officials said the rain badly affected two key links of East district \u2014 Korangi Causeway and Korangi Road \u2014 which link Korangi with the rest of the city, as people opted for alternative routes which further swelled the number of vehicles on available arteries.  The vehicular traffic on roads along Liaquatabad, some blocks of Nazimabad, a few sectors in North Karachi and parts of Shahrah-i-Pakistan remained slow but kept moving after the alternative system to drain the rainwater was installed by authorities. In East district, University Road remained the worst-hit area where hundreds of vehicles were seen lined up after sunset due to accumulated rainwater. Similarly, in Central district construction works on key traffic intersections made the situation difficult for vehicular traffic. The rain also affected the air traffic as many flights from Karachi to different destinations were cancelled due to weather conditions. A spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines said that eight flights from Karachi to Sukkur, Karachi-Gwadar, Karachi-Multan and Sukkur-Islamabad had been cancelled. He said that all measures had been taken in view of the forecast of heavy rains in the city and passengers were being provided with help at the airport in case of delays/cancellation or diversion of their flights. A CAA official said that in all eight flights were cancelled and four were delayed due to rain in Karachi. \t\t\t With the first few drops of rain, the power supply system in the city failed to prove its effectiveness.  The K-Electric blamed \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cheavy rain\u201d for prolonged power failures that extended up to 15 hours in many areas in the city till 11pm. In the evening, the KE claimed to have restored power supply in most parts of the city, but residents from different localities called Dawn offices to share their sufferings due to hours-long power breakdowns even after 11pm. \u201cUnprecedented and heavy rains disrupted power supply to some areas in Korangi, Landhi, Lyari and Bin Qasim,\u201d said the power utility. \u201cThe K-Electric\u2019s rapid response teams are in the field, working swiftly to restore power to all affected areas.\u201d It said: \u201cPower supply to parts of Jail Chowrangi, Gulshan, Nazimabad, Gizri, PNT Colony, Numaish, Punjab Chowrangi and Garden has already been restored. In [a] few cases, power supply to kunda-infested and low-laying areas has been deliberately turned off as a safety precaution to avoid any serious incident. Inconvenience is regretted.\u201d   The local and provincial governments came under criticism over poor response during the rain. However, Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said: \u201cKey roads of the city which always got submerged after rains are not in that bad condition this time. We are only facing challenges in a few areas where drainage system is not capable to handle this amount of rain. But we are going for alternative solutions, which would improve the situation in next few hours.\u201d Meanwhile, the Sindh government announced holiday for educational institutions on Tuesday due to intermittent and continued rains. \u201cThere would be a public holiday for educational institutes, both public and private, across Sindh province on Tuesday because of continued rains,\u201d said Education Secretary Qazi Shahid Pervez.", "category": "Pakistan"},

Imran Khan\u2019s personal Banigala residence is all set to receive some form of permanent regulatory approval. Malik Riaz will facilitate the PTI\u2019s Naya Pakistan Housing Programme, constructing new housing units in Rawalpindi/Islamabad. These are in no particular order; nevertheless, there has to be some logic to these decisions. Sea Breeze was originally constructed as a medical facility, which was subsequently misused. The building\u2019s occupants now say they are willing to hand it over; demolishing it, however, would directly affect at least 200 traders. And, of course, only Malik Riaz can build thousands of new housing units and deliver them in time. But what else ties these decisions together? That naya Pakistan is not a country for most of its own people. That executive, legislative, judicial and regulatory capture is now complete. Let me explain. \u2018Naya\u2019 Pakistan is just \u2018purana\u2019 Pakistan on steroids. At least 12,000 Karachiites lost their homes, shops, and other spaces as part of the demolition drive ordered by the Supreme Court. They included people who had valid permits from various government offices. Some were in Empress Market, while many were unfortunate enough to live or conduct business along the Karachi Circular Railway track. Nothing in their plight \u2014 stories of despondency, destruction, and even death \u2014 could move any authority to deliver any form of relief. In the ill-informed and undue haste to \u2018restore\u2019 Karachi, we brought thousands of the urban poor to the streets. But of course, the 200 Sea Breeze traders had a different kind of access. The story is similar in Islamabad. An ongoing demolition drive against khokhas has rendered hundreds jobless; why should we care that most were validly licensed to operate? By one count, around 500 khokhas were established after obtaining due permits from competent authorities. For years, they provided critical local needs of food, water, and a place to hang out in poor settlements and other areas with low commercial activity where formal restaurateurs wouldn\u2019t venture. But, of course, a raging messiah quickly realised that Islamabad\u2019s master plan didn\u2019t permit the poor to eat. However, did the same master plan allow for Imran Khan\u2019s palatial mansion in Banigala? Never mind that the prime minister lives there! Ironically, Mr Khan\u2019s own petitions in judicial forums have led to the demolition of dozens of buildings in Banigala, driving out his poorer neighbours even as his own mansion looks forward to some form of regularisation. Master plans are always problematic. They reflect economic and political power structures without catering to the most downtrodden; on top is the wanton disregard in which the elite hold them. Khokhas and jhuggis, on the other hand, are poor families\u2019 way out from their exclusion from master plans. This explains both the Banigala mansion and the appearance of slums and khokhas in Pakistan\u2019s \u2018only\u2019 planned city. Regularisation is thus not the problem. Instead, the question is: who gets what? Twelve thousand poor traders and slum dwellers can go to hell but not 200; 500 khokhas can be demolished but not one man\u2019s palace. Refugees and migrants can be brutally evicted from informal settlements in Islamabad, but the same state can do nothing about senators occupying educational institutions\u2019 lands in the heart of the same city. In fact, why not go even further and link a pro-poor housing project with the country\u2019s biggest private encroacher in history (as established by the court)? We\u2019re driving out the urban poor from their \u2018encroachments\u2019 even as the government validates and further strengthens criminals. To rub salt into our wounds, our messiahs cite economic miseries to raise taxes, hike utility tariffs for the poorest, and reduce or eliminate subsidies even on critical facilities like urban transit. Alongside, and in a parallel reality where our coffers are bursting at the seams, come the daftest policy moves \u2014 like the stock market bailout. When you have too much money, a market controlled by the most powerful few deserves more public billions than a transit system used by hundreds of thousands of people a day. There are countless other examples. Only recently, we had the luggage plastic wrap fiasco. Can we not speculate that the regulator and executive both connived to invent a way for a blue-eyed bigot to make some money? And so what? Remember corporate tax cuts? Go back to purana Pakistan, and remember IPPs with billions of dollars in committed capacity payments?  This naya Pakistan is just purana Pakistan on steroids: those who can, get their way; those who can\u2019t, get kicked; and political and judicial leaders continue to act oblivious to the plight of the people. Purana woe was us. Naya woe is us. And, for that, woe to our messiahs, and woe to us for so eagerly selecting them.", "category": "Archive"},

This means a relatively higher proportion of the country\u2019s educated workers is sitting at home hoping to find a decent job. Students dream about enrolling in top-tier universities because they believe that those institutions are their gateway to well-paid jobs and professional success. Unfortunately, only a handful of institutions across all fields of study can truly groom their students. So the problem of most varsities being under par is a severe one. Top business schools are considered a ticket to an executive job in any top corporation. This is due to the fact that these schools recognise the needs of the market and develop their students accordingly. The courses they offer, the curriculum they teach, the quality of their faculty and their contact base are such that their students don\u2019t have a hard time finding jobs. The quality of coursework and the faculty in universities are severely under par  Even though there some business schools that are working hard to achieve the top local standard, most schools are still at rock bottom. The quality of their coursework and faculty, their enrolment criteria and the average student profile are severely under par. Obsolete textbooks, lack of substantial research and students technically bribing their institutions to get their degrees are common. In science as well, only a handful of universities produce quality doctors and engineers. Graduates from most medical schools are unskilled and lack confidence to actually deal with a patient. That is because too much theoretical teaching takes place at medical schools without any emphasis on practical work.  Similarly, we often hear jokes about unemployed engineers. Despite being a distinguished field globally, engineering does not get the respect it deserves in Pakistan. That is so because too many universities produce too many engineers even though their demand is limited owing to Pakistan\u2019s underdeveloped industrial base. Lots of schools have a low merit criterion. So it\u2019s easy for anyone to enrol, which raises the supply of potential engineers. Many engineering schools lack advanced labs with relevant instruments. They are theoretical in their teaching and students are encouraged to learn by rote. That is why such students struggle to find a decent job in the local market. Most graduates from middle-class or lower-class households can\u2019t afford to go abroad to find jobs as the local market is too saturated. They can\u2019t afford to live or even study abroad. They often can\u2019t fulfil immigration requirements of developed countries. Students of social sciences and humanities face the worst prospects. As few organisations in Pakistan are interested in research, such graduates suffer the most. Most of them get employment in academia. But even there, supply exceeds demand. Of late, however, some corporations have started hiring psychology specialists as HR executives. Some psychologists open their clinics. But their businesses don\u2019t generally do well because of the negative perception about seeking mental health in our society. The Higher Education Commission (HEC) is the regulatory body for all universities in Pakistan. It is its responsibility to make sure the quality of university education is up to par. The HEC is trying to push institutions to recruit more PhDs as faculty members. According to Employers\u2019 Federation of Pakistan Chairman Majyd Aziz, faculty members do not have the exposure to trade and industry. \u201cThey are normally fresh graduates who teach through PowerPoint presentations made through textbooks. They are unable to back their teaching with practical experience. Universities should send their faculty members to the industry for three to six months on a voluntary basis. This will give them practical knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cPakistan needs proficient managers, not hopeless drones with degrees.\u201d Shazia Farooq, a visiting faculty member at the Institute of Business Administration, said that students should enhance their skills through Massive Open Online Courses, which are available online for free. \u201cStudents should also improve their work ethic and attitude. They should be more willing to put in extra hours since supply is becoming increasingly elastic,\u201d she said. ", "category": "Archive"},
